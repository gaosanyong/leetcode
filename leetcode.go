/*1. Two Sum (Easy)
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two 
numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would 
have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can 
return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:
* 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
* -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
* -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
* Only one valid answer exists.*/

func twoSum(nums []int, target int) []int {
    seen := make(map[int]int)
    for i, x := range nums {
        j, found := seen[target-x]
        if found {
            return []int{j, i}
        }
        seen[x] = i
    }
    return []int{}
}


/*9. Palindrome Number (Easy)
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes
             121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Constraints: -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?*/

func isPalindrome(x int) bool {
    r := 0
    for xx := x; xx > 0; xx /= 10 {
        r = 10*r + xx % 10
    }
    return x == r
}


/*13. Roman to Integer (Easy)
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and
M.
    Symbol       Value
    I             1
    V             5
    X             10
    L             50
    C             100
    D             500
    M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together.
12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII,
which is XX + V + II. Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest
from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the
number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it
making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as
IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
* I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
* X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
* C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Example 1:
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

Example 3:
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 15
* s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
* It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].*/

func romanToInt(s string) int {
    symbol := map[rune]int {
        'I' : 1,
        'V' : 5,
        'X' : 10,
        'L' : 50,
        'C' : 100,
        'D' : 500,
        'M' : 1000,
    }
    ans := 0
    for i, ch := range s {
        if i+1 < len(s) && symbol[ch] < symbol[rune(s[i+1])] {
            ans -= symbol[ch]
        } else {
            ans += symbol[ch]
        }
    }
    return ans
}


/*14. Longest Common Prefix (Easy)
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of
strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

Constraints:
* 1 <= strs.length <= 200
* 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
* strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.*/

func longestCommonPrefix(strs []string) string {
    for j, _ := range strs[0] {
        for i := 1; i < len(strs); i++ {
            if j == len(strs[i]) || strs[0][j] != strs[i][j] {
                return strs[0][:j]
            }
        }
    }
    return strs[0]
}


/*20. Valid Parentheses (Easy)
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']',
determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
* Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
* Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
* Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example 1:
Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: s = "([])"
Output: true

Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
* s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.*/

func isValid(s string) bool {
    pair := map[rune]rune {
        ')' : '(',
        ']' : '[',
        '}' : '{',
    }
    stack := []rune{}
    for _, ch := range s {
        if strings.ContainsRune("([{", ch) {
            stack = append(stack, ch)
        } else {
            sz := len(stack)
            if sz == 0 || stack[sz-1] != pair[ch] {
                return false
            }
            stack = stack[:sz-1]
        }
    }
    return len(stack) == 0
}


/*21. Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy)
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2. Merge the
two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the
nodes of the first two lists. Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Example 2:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:
* The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
* Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.*/

func mergeTwoLists(list1 *ListNode, list2 *ListNode) *ListNode {
    dummy := &ListNode{}
    for node := dummy; list1 != nil || list2 != nil; node = node.Next {
        if list1 == nil || list2 != nil && list1.Val >= list2.Val {
            node.Next = list2
            list2 = list2.Next
        } else {
            node.Next = list1
            list1 = list1.Next
        }
    }
    return dummy.Next
}


/*26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (Easy)
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the
duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The
relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number
of unique elements in nums. Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be
k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
* Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the
  unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The
  remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
* Return k.

Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:
    int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
    int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

    int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

    assert k == expectedNums.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
    }
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of
             nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It does not matter what you leave
             beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of
             nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. It does not matter what
             you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
* -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
* nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.*/

func removeDuplicates(nums []int) int {
    k := 0
    for i, x := range nums {
        if i == 0 || nums[i-1] < x {
            nums[k] = x
            k++
        }
    }
    return k
}


/*27. Remove Element (Easy)
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in
nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number
of elements in nums which are not equal to val. Consider the number of elements
in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the
following things:
* Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the
  elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not
  important as well as the size of nums.
* Return k.

Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:
    int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
    int val = ...; // Value to remove
    int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                                // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

    int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

    assert k == expectedNums.length;
    sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
    for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
        assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
    }
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of
             nums being 2. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned
             k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of
             nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4. Note that the five elements can
             be returned in any order. It does not matter what you leave beyond
             the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Constraints:
* 0 <= nums.length <= 100
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 50
* 0 <= val <= 100*/

func removeElement(nums []int, val int) int {
    k := 0
    for _, x := range nums {
        if x != val {
            nums[k] = x
            k++
        }
    }
    return k
}


/*28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String (Easy)
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence
of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6. The first occurrence is at index 0,
             so we return 0.

Example 2:
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

Constraints:
* 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4
* haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.*/

func strStr(haystack string, needle string) int {
    return strings.Index(haystack, needle)

/*35. Search Insert Position (Easy)
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index
if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were
inserted in order. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
* -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
* nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
* -10^4 <= target <= 10^4*/

func searchInsert(nums []int, target int) int {
    lo, hi := 0, len(nums)
    for lo < hi {
        mid := (lo+hi) / 2
        if target <= nums[mid] {
            hi = mid
        } else {
            lo = mid+1
