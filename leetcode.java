	/*1. Two Sum (Easy)
	Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of 
	the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each 
	input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element 
	twice. You can return the answer in any order.

	Example 1:
	Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
	Output: [0,1]
	Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

	Example 2:
	Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
	Output: [1,2]

	Example 3:
	Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
	Output: [0,1]

	Constraints:
	* 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
	* -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
	* -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
	* Only one valid answer exists.

	Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time 
	           complexity?*/

        HashMap<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>(); 
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            int diff = target - nums[i]; 
            if (seen.containsKey(diff)) return new int[]{seen.get(diff), i}; 
            seen.put(nums[i], i); 
        }
        return null; 
    }


    /*9. Palindrome Number (Easy)
	Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

	Example 1:
	Input: x = 121
	Output: true
	Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

	Example 2:
	Input: x = -121
	Output: false
	Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it 
	             becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

	Example 3:
	Input: x = 10
	Output: false
	Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

 	Constraints: -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

	Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?*/

    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0 || x < 0) return false; 
        int rev = 0; 
        for (; x > rev; x /= 10) 
            rev = 10*rev + x%10; 
        return x == rev || x == rev/10; 
    }


    /*13. Roman to Integer (Easy)
	Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D 
	and M.
	    Symbol       Value
	    I             1
	    V             5
	    X             10
	    L             50
	    C             100
	    D             500
	    M             1000
	For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added 
	together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is 
	written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II. Roman numerals are usually written 
	largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is 
	not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is 
	before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to 
	the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where 
	subtraction is used:
	* I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
	* X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
	* C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
	Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

	Example 1:
	Input: s = "III"
	Output: 3
	Explanation: III = 3.

	Example 2:
	Input: s = "LVIII"
	Output: 58
	Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

	Example 3:
	Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
	Output: 1994
	Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

	Constraints:
	* 1 <= s.length <= 15
	* s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
	* It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].*/

    public int romanToInt(String s) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> mp = new HashMap<>() {{
            put('I', 1); 
            put('V', 5); 
            put('X', 10); 
            put('L', 50); 
            put('C', 100); 
            put('D', 500); 
            put('M', 1000); 
        }}; 
        int ans = 0; 
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            if (i+1 < s.length() && mp.get(s.charAt(i)) < mp.get(s.charAt(i+1))) ans -= mp.get(s.charAt(i)); 
            else ans += mp.get(s.charAt(i)); 
        }
        return ans; 
    }


    /*14. Longest Common Prefix (Easy)
	Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array 
	of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

	Example 1:
	Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
	Output: "fl"

	Example 2:
	Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
	Output: ""
	Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

	Constraints:
	* 1 <= strs.length <= 200
	* 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
	* strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.*/

    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        String lo = Collections.min(Arrays.asList(strs)), hi = Collections.max(Arrays.asList(strs)); 
        int i = 0; 
        for (; i < lo.length() && i < hi.length() && lo.charAt(i) == hi.charAt(i); ++i);
