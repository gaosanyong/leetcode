| question_id | int  |
| answer_id   | int  |
| q_num       | int  |
| timestamp   | int  |
+-------------+------+
There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates. action is an 
ENUM of the type: "show", "answer", or "skip". Each row of this table indicates 
the user with ID = id has taken an action with the question question_id at time 
timestamp. If the action taken by the user is "answer", answer_id will contain 
the id of that answer, otherwise, it will be null. q_num is the numeral order 
of the question in the current session. The answer rate for a question is the 
number of times a user answered the question by the number of times a user 
showed the question.

Write an SQL query to report the question that has the highest answer rate. If 
multiple questions have the same maximum answer rate, report the question with 
the smallest question_id. The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |

+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table. Each row of this table contains 
information about the id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree. The 
given structure is always a valid tree. Each node in the tree can be one of 
three types:
* "Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
* "Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
* "Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree. Return the 
result table ordered by id in ascending order. The query result format is in 
the following example.

Example 1:
Input: 
Tree table: +----+------+
            | id | p_id |
            +----+------+

           | 4  | Leaf  |
           | 5  | Leaf  |
           +----+-------+
Explanation: Node 1 is the root node because its parent node is null and it has 
             child nodes 2 and 3. Node 2 is an inner node because it has parent 
             node 1 and child node 4 and 5. Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are leaf nodes 
             because they have parent nodes and they do not have child nodes.

Example 2:
Input: 
Tree table: +----+------+

average occurences across all companies that have this event. An active 
business is a business that has more than one event_type such that their 
occurences is strictly greater than the average activity for that event.

Write an SQL query to find all active businesses. Return the result table in 
any order. The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input: 
Events table: +-------------+------------+------------+
              | business_id | event_type | occurences |
              +-------------+------------+------------+
              | 1           | reviews    | 7          |
              | 3           | reviews    | 3          |
              | 1           | ads        | 11         |
              | 2           | ads        | 7          |
              | 3           | ads        | 6          |
              | 1           | page views | 3          |
              | 2           | page views | 12         |
              +-------------+------------+------------+
Output:                                 +-------------+
                                        | business_id |
                                        +-------------+
                                        | 1           |
                                        +-------------+
Explanation: The average activity for each event can be calculated as follows:
             - 'reviews': (7+3)/2 = 5
             - 'ads': (11+7+6)/3 = 8
             - 'page views': (3+12)/2 = 7.5
             The business with id=1 has 7 'reviews' events (more than 5) and 11 
             'ads' events (more than 8), so it is an active business.*/

SELECT business_id
FROM 
    Events a
    JOIN (SELECT event_type, AVG(occurences) as occurences
          FROM Events 
          GROUP BY event_type) b ON a.event_type = b.event_type AND a.occurences > b.occurences
GROUP BY business_id
HAVING COUNT(a.event_type) > 1

Explanation: The percentage for 2019-07-04 is 50% because only one post of two 
             spam reported posts were removed. The percentage for 2019-07-02 is 
             100% because one post was reported as spam and it was removed. The 
             other days had no spam reports so the average is 
             (50 + 100) / 2 = 75%. Note that the output is only one number and 
             that we do not care about the remove dates.*/

preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called 
immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled. The first order of a customer is 
the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed 
that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first 
orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places. The query result format 
is in the following example.

person_id is the primary key column for this table. This table has the 
information about all people waiting for a bus. The person_id and turn columns 
will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the 
table. turn determines the order of which the people will board the bus, where 
turn=1 denotes the first person to board and turn=n denotes the last person to 
board. weight is the weight of the person in kilograms. There is a queue of 
people waiting to board a bus. However, the bus has a weight limit of 1000 
kilograms, so there may be some people who cannot board.

Write an SQL query to find the person_name of the last person that can fit on 
the bus without exceeding the weight limit. The test cases are generated such 
that the first person does not exceed the weight limit. The query result format 
is in the following example.

column of Transactions table. Each chargeback corresponds to a transaction made 
previously even if they were not approved.

Write an SQL query to find for each month and country: the number of approved 
transactions and their total amount, the number of chargebacks, and their total 
amount. Note: In your query, given the month and country, ignore rows with all 
zeros. Return the result table in any order. The query result format is in the

represented by their IDs in the Teams table (team_id), and they scored 
host_goals and guest_goals goals, respectively. You would like to compute the 
scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as follows:
* A team receives three points if they win a match (i.e., Scored more goals 
  than the opponent team).
* A team receives one point if they draw a match (i.e., Scored the same number 
  of goals as the opponent team).
* A team receives no points if they lose a match (i.e., Scored fewer goals than 
  the opponent team).
Write an SQL query that selects the team_id, team_name and num_points of each 
team in the tournament after all described matches. Return the result table

employee_id is the primary key for this table. Each row of this table indicates 
that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name reports his work 
to his/her direct manager with manager_id. The head of the company is the 
employee with employee_id = 1.

Write an SQL query to find employee_id of all employees that directly or 
indirectly report their work to the head of the company. The indirect relation 
between managers will not exceed three managers as the company is small. Return 
the result table in any order. The query result format is in the following

+----------------+---------+
The table shows the user activities for a factory website. 
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key of this table. 
machine_id is the ID of a machine. process_id is the ID of a process running on 
the machine with ID machine_id. activity_type is an ENUM of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds. 'start' means the 
machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine 
ends the process at the given timestamp. The 'start' timestamp will always be 
before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair. There is a 
factory website that has several machines each running the same number of 
processes. Write an SQL query to find the average time each machine takes to 
complete a process. The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus 
the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to 
complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that 
were run. The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average 
time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places. 

The query result format is in the following example:

Explanation: Sarah won 3 gold medals (190, 193, and 196), so we include her in 
             the result table. Bob won a medal in 3 consecutive contests (190, 
             191, and 192), so we include him in the result table.
                 - Note that he also won a medal in 3 other consecutive 
                   contests (194, 195, and 196).
             Alice won a medal in 3 consecutive contests (191, 192, and 193), 
             so we include her in the result table. Quarz won a medal in 5 
             consecutive contests (190, 191, 192, 193, and 194), so we include 
             them in the result table.

Follow up:
* What if the first condition changed to be "any medal in n or more consecutive 
  contests"? How would you change your solution to get the interview candidates? 
  Imagine that n is the parameter of a stored procedure.
* Some users may not participate in every contest but still perform well in the 
  ones they do. How would you change your solution to only consider contests 
  where the user was a participant? Suppose the registered users for each 
  contest are given in another table.*/

(home_team_id, away_team_id) is the primary key for this table. Each row 
contains information about one match. home_team_goals is the number of goals 
scored by the home team. away_team_goals is the number of goals scored by the 
away team. The winner of the match is the team with the higher number of goals.

Write an SQL query to report the statistics of the league. The statistics 
should be built using the played matches where the winning team gets three 
points and the losing team gets no points. If a match ends with a draw, both 
teams get one point. Each row of the result table should contain:
* team_name - The name of the team in the Teams table.
* matches_played - The number of matches played as either a home or away team.
* points - The total points the team has so far.
* goal_for - The total number of goals scored by the team across all matches.
* goal_against - The total number of goals scored by opponent teams against 
  this team across all matches.
* goal_diff - The result of goal_for - goal_against.
Return the result table in descending order by points. If two or more teams 
have the same points, order them in descending order by goal_diff. If there is 
still a tie, order them by team_name in lexicographical order.

Explanation: For account 3:

             - In 7-2021, the user had an income of 64900.
             We can see that the income exceeded the max income of 21000 for 
             two consecutive months, so we include 3 in the result table.

             - In 7-2021, the user had an income of 56300.
             We can see that the income exceeded the max income in May and July, 
             but not in June. Since the account did not exceed the max income 
             for two consecutive months, we do not include it in the result

Table: Exam
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| score         | int  |
| student_count | int  |
+---------------+------+
score is the primary key for this table. Each row in this table indicates that 
there are student_count students that got at least score points in the exam.
The data in this table will be logically correct, meaning a row recording a 
higher score will have the same or smaller student_count compared to a row 
recording a lower score. More formally, for every two rows i and j in the table, 
if scorei > scorej then student_counti <= student_countj. Every year, each 
school announces a minimum score requirement that a student needs to apply to 
it. The school chooses the minimum score requirement based on the exam results 
of all the students:
* They want to ensure that even if every student meeting the requirement 
  applies, the school can accept everyone.
* They also want to maximize the possible number of students that can apply.
* They must use a score that is in the Exam table.
Write an SQL query to report the minimum score requirement for each school. If 
there are multiple score values satisfying the above conditions, choose the 
smallest one. If the input data is not enough to determine the score, report -1.

Return the result table in any order. The query result format is in the 
following example.

Example 1:
Input:

+-----------+----------+
| school_id | capacity |

| 11        | 744   |
+-----------+-------+
Explanation: 
- School 5: The school's capacity is 48. Choosing 975 as the min score 
  requirement, the school will get at most 10 applications, which is within 
  capacity.
- School 10: The school's capacity is 99. Choosing 844 or 749 as the min score 
  requirement, the school will get at most 76 applications, which is within 
  capacity. We choose the smallest of them, which is 749.
- School 11: The school's capacity is 151. Choosing 744 as the min score 
  requirement, the school will get at most 100 applications, which is within 
  capacity.
- School 9: The data given is not enough to determine the min score requirement. 
  Choosing 975 as the min score, the school may get 10 requests while its 
  capacity is 9. We do not have information about higher scores, hence we 
  report -1.*/

Write an SQL query to report all the orders based on the following criteria:
* If a customer has at least one order of type 0, do not report any order of 
  type 1 from that customer.
* Otherwise, report all the orders of the customer.
Return the result table in any order. The query result format is in the

SQL Schema
Table: Purchases

| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| user_id     | int      |
| time_stamp  | datetime |
| amount      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key for this table. Each row contains 
information about the purchase time and the amount paid for the user with ID 
user_id. A user is eligible for a discount if they had a purchase in the 
inclusive interval of time [startDate, endDate] with at least minAmount amount. 
To convert the dates to times, both dates should be considered as the start of 
the day (i.e., endDate = 2022-03-05 should be considered as the time 2022-03-05 
00:00:00). Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the users that are eligible 
for a discount. Return the result table ordered by user_id. The query result 
format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input: Purchases table:
       +---------+---------------------+--------+
       | user_id | time_stamp          | amount |
       +---------+---------------------+--------+

       +---------+---------------------+--------+
       startDate = 2022-03-08, endDate = 2022-03-20, minAmount = 1000
Output: +---------+
        | user_id |
        +---------+
        | 3       |
        +---------+
Explanation: Out of the three users, only User 3 is eligible for a discount.
             - User 1 had one purchase with at least minAmount amount, but not 
               within the time interval.
             - User 2 had one purchase within the time interval, but with less 
               than minAmount amount.
             - User 3 is the only user who had a purchase that satisfies both 
               conditions.

Employees work in sessions. The number of hours an employee worked can be 
calculated from the sum of the number of minutes the employee worked in all of 
their sessions. The number of minutes in each session is rounded up. For 
example, if the employee worked for 51 minutes and 2 seconds in a session, we 
consider it 52 minutes. Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the employees 
that will be deducted. In other words, report the IDs of the employees that did 
not work the needed hours. Return the result table in any order. The query 
result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+--------------+
| employee_id | needed_hours |
+-------------+--------------+

/*2474. Customers With Strictly Increasing Purchases (Hard)
SQL Schema
Table: Orders
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| order_id     | int  |
| customer_id  | int  |
| order_date   | date |
| price        | int  |
+--------------+------+
order_id is the primary key for this table. Each row contains the id of an 
order, the id of customer that ordered it, the date of the order, and its price.

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the customers with the total purchases 
strictly increasing yearly. The total purchases of a customer in one year is 
the sum of the prices of their orders in that year. If for some year the 
customer did not make any order, we consider the total purchases 0. The first 
year to consider for each customer is the year of their first order. The last 
year to consider for each customer is the year of their last order. Return the 
result table in any order. The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input: 
Orders table:
+----------+-------------+------------+-------+
| order_id | customer_id | order_date | price |
+----------+-------------+------------+-------+
| 1        | 1           | 2019-07-01 | 1100  |

| 9        | 3           | 2018-11-07 | 900   |
+----------+-------------+------------+-------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| customer_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
Explanation: Customer 1: The first year is 2019 and the last year is 2022
               - 2019: 1100 + 1200 = 2300

               - 2021: 3100
               - 2022: 4700
               We can see that the total purchases are strictly increasing 
               yearly, so we include customer 1 in the answer.
         
             Customer 2: The first year is 2015 and the last year is 2017
               - 2015: 700
               - 2016: 0
               - 2017: 1000
               We do not include customer 2 in the answer because the total 
               purchases are not strictly increasing. Note that customer 2 did 
               not make any purchases in 2016.
         
             Customer 3: The first year is 2017, and the last year is 2018
               - 2017: 900
               - 2018: 900
               We can see that the total purchases are strictly increasing 
               yearly, so we include customer 1 in the answer.*/

  tickets, only 2 passengers can get a seat. Therefore, 2 passengers are
  successfully booked, and 1 passenger is on the waitlist.
- Flight 2 has a capacity of 2. Since there are exactly 2 passengers who booked
  tickets, everyone can secure a seat. As a result, 2 passengers successfully
  booked their seats and there are no passengers on the waitlist.
- Flight 3 has a capacity of 1. As there are 2 passengers who have booked

Each row includes X and Y, where both are integers. Table may contain duplicate
values. Two coordindates (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric
coordintes if X1 == Y2 and X2 == Y1. Write a solution that outputs, among all
these symmetric coordintes, only those unique coordinates that satisfy the
condition X1 <= Y1. Return the result table ordered by X and Y (respectively) in
ascending order. The result format is in the following example.

| 21-25      | 54.31     | 45.69     |
+------------+-----------+-----------+
Explanation:
For age group 31-35:
  - There is only one user belonging to this group with the user ID 123.
  - The total time spent on sending snaps by this user is 3.50, and the time
    spent on opening snaps is 4.50 + 1.25 = 5.75.
  - The overall time spent by this user is 3.50 + 5.75 = 9.25.
  - Therefore, the sending snap percentage will be (3.50 / 9.25) * 100 = 37.84,
    and the opening snap percentage will be (5.75 / 9.25) * 100 = 62.16.
For age group 26-30:
  - There is only one user belonging to this group with the user ID 456.
  - The total time spent on sending snaps by this user is 5.67 + 8.24 = 13.91,
    and the time spent on opening snaps is 3.00.
  - The overall time spent by this user is 13.91 + 3.00 = 16.91.
  - Therefore, the sending snap percentage will be (13.91 / 16.91) * 100 =
    82.26, and the opening snap percentage will be (3.00 / 16.91) * 100 = 17.74.
For age group 21-25:
  - There is only one user belonging to this group with the user ID 789.
  - The total time spent on sending snaps by this user is 6.24, and the time
    spent on opening snaps is 5.25.
  - The overall time spent by this user is 6.24 + 5.25 = 11.49.
  - Therefore, the sending snap percentage will be (6.24 / 11.49) * 100 = 54.31,
    and the opening snap percentage will be (5.25 / 11.49) * 100 = 45.69.

/*3436. Find Valid Emails (Easy)
Table: Users
+-----------------+---------+
| Column Name     | Type    |
+-----------------+---------+
| user_id         | int     |
| email           | varchar |
+-----------------+---------+
(user_id) is the unique key for this table. Each row contains a user's unique ID
and email address. Write a solution to find all the valid email addresses. A
valid email address meets the following criteria:
* It contains exactly one @ symbol.
* The part before the @ symbol contains only alphanumeric characters and
  underscores.
* The part after the @ symbol contains a domain name that starts with a letter
  and ends with .com.
Return the result table ordered by user_id in ascending order.

Example:
Input:
Users table:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | email               |
+---------+---------------------+
| 1       | alice@example.com   |
| 2       | bob_at_example.com  |
| 3       | charlie@example.net |
| 4       | david@domain.com    |
| 5       | eve@invalid         |
+---------+---------------------+
Output:
+---------+-------------------+
| user_id | email             |
+---------+-------------------+
| 1       | alice@example.com |
| 4       | david@domain.com  |
+---------+-------------------+
Explanation:
* alice@example.com is valid because it contains one @, alice is alphanumeric,
  and example.com starts with a letter and ends with .com.
* bob_at_example.com is invalid because it contains an underscore instead of an
  @.
* charlie@example.net is invalid because the domain does not end with .com.
* david@domain.com is valid because it meets all criteria.
* eve@invalid is invalid because the domain does not end with .com.
