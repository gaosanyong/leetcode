1. Two Sum (Easy)
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two
numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would
have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can
return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:
* 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
* -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
* -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
* Only one valid answer exists.

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time
           complexity?

def two_sum(nums, target)
    loc = {}
    nums.each_with_index do |x, i|
        if loc.key?(target-x)
            return [loc[target-x], i]
        end
        loc[x] = i
    end
end

9. Palindrome Number (Easy)
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes
             121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Constraints: -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
=end

def is_palindrome(x)
    return false if x < 0 || x % 10 == 0 && x != 0
    y = 0
    while x > y
        y = 10*y + x % 10
        x /= 10
    end
    return [y, y / 10].include?(x)
end

13. Roman to Integer (Easy)
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and
M.
    Symbol       Value
    I             1
    V             5
    X             10
    L             50
    C             100
    D             500
    M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together.
12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII,
which is XX + V + II. Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest
from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the
number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it
making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as
IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
* I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
* X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
* C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Example 1:
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

Example 3:
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 15
* s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
* It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

def roman_to_int(s)
    symbol = {'I' => 1, 'V' => 5, 'X' => 10, 'L' => 50, 'C' => 100, 'D' => 500, 'M' => 1000}
    ans = 0
    s.each_char.with_index do |ch, i|
        if i+1 < s.size && symbol[ch] < symbol[s[i+1]]
            ans -= symbol[ch]
        else
            ans += symbol[ch]
        end
    end
    return ans
end


=begin
14. Longest Common Prefix (Easy)
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of
strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

Constraints:
* 1 <= strs.length <= 200
* 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
* strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.
=end

def longest_common_prefix(strs)
    ans = []
    strs[0].each_char.with_index do |ch, j|
        break unless (1..strs.size-1).each do |i|
            break if j == strs[i].size || ch != strs[i][j]
        end
        ans.push(ch)
    end
    return ans.join
end
