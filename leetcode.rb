1. Two Sum (Easy)
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two
numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would
have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can
return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:
* 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
* -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
* -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
* Only one valid answer exists.

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time
           complexity?

def two_sum(nums, target)
    loc = {}
    nums.each_with_index do |x, i|
        if loc.key?(target-x)
            return [loc[target-x], i]
        end
        loc[x] = i
    end
end

=begin
9. Palindrome Number (Easy)
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes
             121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Constraints: -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

def is_palindrome(x)
    return false if x < 0 || x % 10 == 0 && x != 0
    y = 0
    while x > y
        y = 10*y + x % 10
        x /= 10
    end
    return [y, y / 10].include?(x)
end
