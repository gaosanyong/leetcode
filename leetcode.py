    """8. String to Integer (atoi) (Medium)
	Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer. The function first 
	discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-
	whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes 
	an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits 
	as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value. The string can 
	contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, 
	which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function. If 
	the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid 
	integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty 
	or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed. If 
	no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

	Note:

	Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
	Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers 
	within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. If the numerical 
	value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or

	Example 1:
	Input: "42"
	Output: 42

	Example 2:
	Input: "   -42"
	Output: -42
	Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
	             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.

	Example 3:
	Input: "4193 with words"
	Output: 4193
	Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.

	Example 4:
	Input: "words and 987"
	Output: 0
	Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical 
	             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.

	Example 5:
	Input: "-91283472332"
	Output: -2147483648
	Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

	2.     11
	3.     21
	4.     1211
	5.     111221
	1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
	11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
	21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

	groups of the same digit.

	Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

	Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other

	moves the directory up a level. Note that the returned canonical path must 
	always begin with a slash /, and there must be only a single slash / 
	between two directory names. The last directory name (if it exists) must 
	not end with a trailing /. Also, the canonical path must be the shortest 
	string representing the absolute path.

	Example 1:
	Input: "/home/"

	Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

	To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two

	We say that "rgeat" is a scrambled string of "great". Similarly, if we

    """134. Gas Station (Medium)
	There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at 
	station i is gas[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs 
	cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You 
	begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. Return the 
	starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in 
	the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

	Note:
	If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
	Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.

	Example 1:
	Input: 
	gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
	cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

	Explanation:
	Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
	Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
	Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7

	gas  = [2,3,4]

	Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
	You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.

    """157. Read N Characters Given Read4 (Easy)
	Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given 
	method read4, implement a method to read n characters. 
	 
	Method read4:
	The API read4 reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes 
	those characters into the buffer array buf4. The return value is the number 
	of actual characters read. Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much 
	like FILE *fp in C.

	Definition of read4:
	    Parameter:  char[] buf4
	    Returns:    int
	Note: buf4[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be 
	      copied to buf4[]

	Below is a high level example of how read4 works:
	File file("abcde"); // File is "abcde", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
	char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
	read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
	read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 = "e", fp points to end of file
	read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 = "", fp points to end of file

	Method read:
	By using the read4 method, implement the method read that reads n 
	characters from the file and store it in the buffer array buf. Consider 
	that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The return value is the 
	number of actual characters read.

	Definition of read:
	    Parameters:	char[] buf, int n
	    Returns:	int
	Note: buf[] is destination not source, you will need to write the results to buf[]

	Example 1:

	Input: file = "abc", n = 4
	Output: 3
	Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abc". We 
	             read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3. Note 
	             that "abc" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the 
	             destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

	Example 2:
	Input: file = "abcde", n = 5
	Output: 5
	Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abcde". We 
	             read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

	Example 3:
	Input: file = "abcdABCD1234", n = 12
	Output: 12
	Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abcdABCD1234". 
	             We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.
	
	Example 4:
	Input: file = "leetcode", n = 5
	Output: 5
	Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "leetc". We 
	             read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

	Note:
	* Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly, the file is only 
	  accesible for read4 but not for read.
	* The read function will only be called once for each test case.
	* You may assume the destination buffer array, buf, is guaranteed to have

	Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

	Notes:
	If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

	given the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape 
	photo (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these 
	buildings collectively (Figure B).

	Buildings Skyline Contour
	The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of 
	integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left 
	and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It 
	is guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. 
	You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an 
	absolutely flat surface at height 0. For instance, the dimensions of all 
	buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], 
	[15 20 10], [19 24 8] ]. The output is a list of "key points" (red dots in 
	Figure B) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that 
	uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a 
	horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the rightmost 
	building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and 
	always has zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent 
	buildings should be considered part of the skyline contour. For instance, 
	the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], 
	[12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].

	Notes:
	The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range 
	[0, 10000]. The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left 
	x position Li. The output list must be sorted by the x position. There must 
	be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. 
	For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable;

	Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or
	dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, 
	vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above 
	Wikipedia article):

	* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
	* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
	* Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
	* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
	
	Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board 
	given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above 
	rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and 
	deaths occur simultaneously.

	Example:
	Input: 
	[
	  [0,1,0],

	  at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their 
	  updated values to update other cells.

	Given a pattern and a string s, return true if s matches the pattern. A 
	string s matches a pattern if there is some bijective mapping of single

    """690. Employee Importance (Easy)
	You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the 
	employee's unique id, their importance value and their direct subordinates' 
	id. For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is 
	the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, 
	respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and 
	employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that 
	although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship 
	is not direct. Now given the employee information of a company, and an 
	employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee 
	and all their subordinates.

	Example 1:
	Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1

	Explanation: Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct 
	             subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have 
	             importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee

    """752. Open the Lock (Medium)
	You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 
	slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The wheels can 
	rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or 
	'0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot. The lock 
	initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels. 
	You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays 
	any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will 
	be unable to open it. Given a target representing the value of the wheels 
	that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns 
	required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.

	Example 1:
	Input: deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
	Output: 6
	Explanation:
	A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" -> "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
	Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202" would be invalid,
	because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end "0102".

	Example 2:
	Input: deadends = ["8888"], target = "0009"
	Output: 1
	Explanation:
	We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from "0000" -> "0009".

	Example 3:
	Input: ghosts = [[2,0]], target = [1,0]

    """831. Masking Personal Information (Medium)
	We are given a personal information string S, which may represent either an 
	email address or a phone number. We would like to mask this personal 
	information according to the following rules:

	1. Email address:
	We define a name to be a string of length ≥ 2 consisting of only lowercase 
	letters a-z or uppercase letters A-Z. An email address starts with a name, 
	followed by the symbol '@', followed by a name, followed by the dot '.' and 
	followed by a name. All email addresses are guaranteed to be valid and in 
	the format of "name1@name2.name3". To mask an email, all names must be 
	converted to lowercase and all letters between the first and last letter of 
	the first name must be replaced by 5 asterisks '*'.

	2. Phone number:
	A phone number is a string consisting of only the digits 0-9 or the 
	characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '}. You may assume a phone 
	number contains 10 to 13 digits. The last 10 digits make up the local 
	number, while the digits before those make up the country code. Note that 
	the country code is optional. We want to expose only the last 4 digits and 
	mask all other digits. The local number should be formatted and masked as 
	"***-***-1111", where 1 represents the exposed digits. To mask a phone 
	number with country code like "+111 111 111 1111", we write it in the form 
	"+***-***-***-1111".  The '+' sign and the first '-' sign before the local 
	number should only exist if there is a country code.  For example, a 12 
	digit phone number mask should start with "+**-". Note that extraneous 
	characters like "(", ")", " ", as well as extra dashes or plus signs not 
	part of the above formatting scheme should be removed.

	Return the correct "mask" of the information provided.

	Example 1:
	Input: "LeetCode@LeetCode.com"
	Output: "l*****e@leetcode.com"
	Explanation: All names are converted to lowercase, and the letters between 
	             the first and last letter of the first name is replaced by 5 
	             asterisks. Therefore, "leetcode" -> "l*****e".

	Example 2:
	Input: "AB@qq.com"
	Output: "a*****b@qq.com"
	Explanation: There must be 5 asterisks between the first and last letter 
	             of the first name "ab". Therefore, "ab" -> "a*****b".
	
	Example 3:
	Input: "1(234)567-890"
	Output: "***-***-7890"
	Explanation: 10 digits in the phone number, which means all digits make up 
	             the local number.

	Example 4:
	Input: "86-(10)12345678"
	Output: "+**-***-***-5678"

    """833. Find And Replace in String (Medium)
	To some string S, we will perform some replacement operations that replace 
	groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size). Each 
	replacement operation has 3 parameters: a starting index i, a source word x 
	and a target word y.  The rule is that if x starts at position i in the 
	original string S, then we will replace that occurrence of x with y.  If 
	not, we do nothing. For example, if we have S = "abcd" and we have some 
	replacement operation i = 2, x = "cd", y = "ffff", then because "cd" starts 
	at position 2 in the original string S, we will replace it with "ffff". 
	Using another example on S = "abcd", if we have both the replacement 
	operation i = 0, x = "ab", y = "eee", as well as another replacement 
	operation i = 2, x = "ec", y = "ffff", this second operation does nothing 
	because in the original string S[2] = 'c', which doesn't match x[0] = 'e'. 
	All these operations occur simultaneously.  

	It's guaranteed that there won't be any overlap in replacement: for example, 
	S = "abc", indexes = [0, 1], sources = ["ab","bc"] is not a valid test case.

	Example 1:
	Input: S = "abcd", indexes = [0, 2], sources = ["a", "cd"], targets = ["eee", "ffff"]
	Output: "eeebffff"
	Explanation: "a" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee".
	             "cd" starts at index 2 in S, so it's replaced by "ffff".

	Example 2:
	Input: S = "abcd", indexes = [0, 2], sources = ["ab","ec"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]
	Output: "eeecd"
	Explanation: "ab" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee".
	             "ec" doesn't starts at index 2 in the original S, so we do nothing.

	N cars are going to the same destination along a one lane road. The

	(in miles per hour), and initial position position[i] miles towards the 
	target along the road. A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it 
	can catch up to it, and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The 
	distance between these two cars is ignored - they are assumed to have the 
	same position. A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the 
	same position and same speed.  Note that a single car is also a car fleet. 
	If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will 
	still be considered as one car fleet. How many car fleets will arrive at

	Example 1:

	Example 2:

	Explanation: Play the 0th token (100) face up, your power becomes 50 and

	2. Play the 3rd token (400) face down, your power becomes 500 and score becomes 0.
	3. Play the 1st token (200) face up, your power becomes 300 and score becomes 1.

	In a deck of cards, every card has a unique integer. You can order the deck

	2) If there are still cards in the deck, put the next top card of the deck

	3) If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1.  Otherwise, stop.

    """1024. Video Stitching (Medium)
	You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted T 
	seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have 
	varied lengths. Each video clip clips[i] is an interval: it starts at time 
	clips[i][0] and ends at time clips[i][1].  We can cut these clips into 
	segments freely: for example, a clip [0, 7] can be cut into segments 
	[0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7]. Return the minimum number of clips needed so that 
	we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event 
	([0, T]).  If the task is impossible, return -1.

	Example 1:
	Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], T = 10
	Output: 3
	Explanation: 
	We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
	Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
	We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
	Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].

	Example 2:

	Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several 
	stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is 
	an integer given in the array stoneValue. Alice and Bob take turns, with 
	Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2 or 3 
	stones from the first remaining stones in the row. The score of each player 
	is the sum of values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 
	initially. The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and 
	the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. 
	The game continues until all the stones have been taken. Assume Alice and 
	Bob play optimally. Return "Alice" if Alice will win, "Bob" if Bob will win 
	or "Tie" if they end the game with the same score.

	Example 1:
	Input: values = [1,2,3,7]
	Output: "Bob"
	Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three 
	             piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and 
	             Bob wins.

	Example 2:

	Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win 
	             and leave Bob with negative score. If Alice chooses one pile 
	             her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. 
	             The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and 
	             lose. If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the 
	             next move Bob's score becomes 3. The next move Alice will take 
	             the pile with value = -9 and also lose. Remember that both 
	             play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that 
	             makes her win.

	Input: boxes = [1,2,2,3,4], warehouse = [3,4,1,2]

	Explanation:
	We can store the boxes in the following order:
	1- Put the yellow box in room 2 from either the left or right side.
	2- Put the orange box in room 3 from the right side.
	3- Put the green box in room 1 from the left side.
	4- Put the red box in room 0 from the left side.
	Notice that there are other valid ways to put 4 boxes such as swapping the 
	red and green boxes or the red and orange boxes.

	Example 2:
	Input: boxes = [3,5,5,2], warehouse = [2,1,3,4,5]
	Output: 3
	Explanation: It's not possible to put the two boxes of height 5 in the 
	             warehouse since there's only 1 room of height >= 5. Other 
	             valid solutions are to put the green box in room 2 or to put 
	             the orange box first in room 2 before putting the green and

	Explanation: The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible

	Output: 2
	Explanation: We cannot remove a single element to get a sum divisible by 9. 
	             The best way is to remove the subarray [5,2], leaving us with

	LeetCode company workers use key-cards to unlock office doors. Each time a 
	worker uses their key-card, the security system saves the worker's name and 
	the time when it was used. The system emits an alert if any worker uses the 
	key-card three or more times in a one-hour period. You are given a list of 
	strings keyName and keyTime where [keyName[i], keyTime[i]] corresponds to a 
	person's name and the time when their key-card was used in a single day. 
	Access times are given in the 24-hour time format "HH:MM", such as "23:51"

    """1606. Find Servers That Handled Most Number of Requests (Hard)
	You have k servers numbered from 0 to k-1 that are being used to handle 
	multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational 
	capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests 
	are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:
	* The ith (0-indexed) request arrives.
	* If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
	* If the (i % k)th server is available, assign the request to that server.
	* Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping 
	  around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, 
	  if the ith server is busy, try to assign the request to the (i+1)th 
	  server, then the (i+2)th server, and so on.
	You are given a strictly increasing array arrival of positive integers, 
	where arrival[i] represents the arrival time of the ith request, and 
	another array load, where load[i] represents the load of the ith request 
	(the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). 
	A server is considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests 
	successfully among all the servers. Return a list containing the IDs 
	(0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). You may return the IDs in any order.

	Example 1:
	Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] 
	Output: [1] 
	Explanation:
	All of the servers start out available.
	The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.
	Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.
	Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.
	Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.

	Example 2:
	Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]
	Output: [0]
	Explanation:
	The first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.
	Request 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.
	Server 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each. Hence server 0 is the busiest server.

	Example 3:
	Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3], load = [10,12,11]

    """1620. Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality (Medium)
	You are given an array of network towers towers and an integer radius, 
	where towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi] denotes the ith network tower with location 
	(xi, yi) and quality factor qi. All the coordinates are integral 
	coordinates on the X-Y plane, and the distance between two coordinates is 
	the Euclidean distance. The integer radius denotes the maximum distance in 
	which the tower is reachable. The tower is reachable if the distance is 
	less than or equal to radius. Outside that distance, the signal becomes 
	garbled, and the tower is not reachable. The signal quality of the ith 
	tower at a coordinate (x, y) is calculated with the formula ⌊qi / (1 + d)⌋, 
	where d is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The network 
	quality at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the 
	reachable towers. Return the integral coordinate where the network quality 
	is maximum. If there are multiple coordinates with the same network quality, 
	return the lexicographically minimum coordinate.

	Note:
	A coordinate (x1, y1) is lexicographically smaller than (x2, y2) if either 
	x1 < x2 or x1 == x2 and y1 < y2. ⌊val⌋ is the greatest integer less than or

	Output: [2,1]
	Explanation: 
	At coordinate (2, 1) the total quality is 13
	- Quality of 7 from (2, 1) results in ⌊7 / (1 + sqrt(0)⌋ = ⌊7⌋ = 7
	- Quality of 5 from (1, 2) results in ⌊5 / (1 + sqrt(2)⌋ = ⌊2.07⌋ = 2
	- Quality of 9 from (3, 1) results in ⌊9 / (1 + sqrt(1)⌋ = ⌊4.5⌋ = 4
	No other coordinate has higher quality.

	Given an m x n matrix, return a new matrix answer where answer[row][col] is 
	the rank of matrix[row][col]. The rank is an integer that represents how

	* The rank is an integer starting from 1.
	* If two elements p and q are in the same row or column, then:
		- If p < q then rank(p) < rank(q)
		- If p == q then rank(p) == rank(q)

	The rank of matrix[0][1] is 2 because matrix[0][1] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.

	are represented as a string, where each character is either:
	* 'H', meaning move horizontally (go right), or
	* 'V', meaning move vertically (go down).
	Multiple instructions will lead Bob to destination. For example, if 
	destination is (2, 3), both "HHHVV" and "HVHVH" are valid instructions. 
	However, Bob is very picky. Bob has a lucky number k, and he wants the kth 
	lexicographically smallest instructions that will lead him to destination. 
	k is 1-indexed. Given an integer array destination and an integer k, return 
	the kth lexicographically smallest instructions that will take Bob to destination.

	Example 1:
	Input: destination = [2,3], k = 1

	You are given an integer array nums of even length n and an integer limit.

	- Bob removes 5 and gets 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 8, stones = [3,1,4].

	Given n cuboids where the dimensions of the ith cuboid is 
	cuboids[i] = [widthi, lengthi, heighti] (0-indexed). Choose a subset of 
	cuboids and place them on each other. You can place cuboid i on cuboid j if 
	widthi <= widthj and lengthi <= lengthj and heighti <= heightj. You can 
	rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by rotating it to put it on another 
	cuboid. Return the maximum height of the stacked cuboids.

	Example 1:
	Input: cuboids = [[50,45,20],[95,37,53],[45,23,12]]
	Output: 190
	Explanation:
	Cuboid 1 is placed on the bottom with the 53x37 side facing down with height 95.
	Cuboid 0 is placed next with the 45x20 side facing down with height 50.
	Cuboid 2 is placed next with the 23x12 side facing down with height 45.

	You are given a phone number as a string number. number consists of digits,

	in a certain manner. Firstly, remove all spaces and dashes. Then, group the 
	digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until there are 4 or fewer 
	digits. The final digits are then grouped as follows:
	* 2 digits: A single block of length 2.
	* 3 digits: A single block of length 3.
	* 4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.
	The blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process 
	should never produce any blocks of length 1 and produce at most two blocks 
	of length 2. Return the phone number after formatting.

	Example 1:
	Input: number = "1-23-45 6"
	Output: "123-456"
	Explanation: The digits are "123456".
	Step 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is "123".
	Step 2: There are 3 digits remaining, so put them in a single block of length 3. The 2nd block is "456".

	Step 2: There are 4 digits left, so split them into two blocks of length 2. The blocks are "45" and "67".

	Given an integer n, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:

	* Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.
	* For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two 
	  occurrences of i is exactly i.
	The distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the 
	absolute difference of their indices, |j - i|. Return the lexicographically 
	largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there 
	is always a solution. A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a 
	sequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b 
	differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b. 
	For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because 
	the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater 
	than 5.

	You are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes

	piles, take one stone from each, and add 1 point to your score. The game 
	stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no 
	more available moves). Given three integers a​​​​​, b,​​​​​ and c​​​​​, return the 
	maximum score you can get.

	Example 1:
	Input: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6
	Output: 6

	There is a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) 
	consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 edges. 
	Each node has a value associated with it, and the root of the tree is node 
	0. To represent this tree, you are given an integer array nums and a 2D 
	array edges. Each nums[i] represents the ith node's value, and each 
	edges[j] = [uj, vj] represents an edge between nodes uj and vj in the tree. 
	Two values x and y are coprime if gcd(x, y) == 1 where gcd(x, y) is the 
	greatest common divisor of x and y. An ancestor of a node i is any other 
	node on the shortest path from node i to the root. A node is not considered

	You are given two integers, x and y, which represent your current location 
	on a Cartesian grid: (x, y). You are also given an array points where each 
	points[i] = [ai, bi] represents that a point exists at (ai, bi). A point is 
	valid if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your

	Manhattan distance from your current location. If there are multiple, 
	return the valid point with the smallest index. If there are no valid 
	points, return -1. The Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and

	- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.
	- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.
	- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.
	- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.
	Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.

	Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
	- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.
	- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.
	- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.
	- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.
	Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).

Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It

put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. 

When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently 
used item before inserting a new item. The cache is initialized with a positive 
capacity.

Follow up: Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?

Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext(), design 
and implement a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it 
essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to 
next().

Example:
Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: [1,2,3].
Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.
Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after 
that still return 2. 
You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. 
Calling hasNext() after that should return false.

"""288. Unique Word Abbreviation (Medium)
The abbreviation of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, the number 
of characters between the first and last letter, and its last letter. If a word 
has only two characters, then it is an abbreviation of itself.

For example:
* dog --> d1g because there is one letter between the first letter 'd' and the 
  last letter 'g'.
* internationalization --> i18n because there are 18 letters between the first 
  letter 'i' and the last letter 'n'.
* it --> it because any word with only two characters is an abbreviation of 
  itself.

Implement the ValidWordAbbr class:
* ValidWordAbbr(String[] dictionary) Initializes the object with a dictionary 
  of words.
* boolean isUnique(string word) Returns true if either of the following 
  conditions are met (otherwise returns false):
  + There is no word in dictionary whose abbreviation is equal to word's 
    abbreviation.
  + For any word in dictionary whose abbreviation is equal to word's 
    abbreviation, that word and word are the same.

Example 1:
Input: ["ValidWordAbbr", "isUnique", "isUnique", "isUnique", "isUnique"]
       [[["deer", "door", "cake", "card"]], ["dear"], ["cart"], ["cane"], ["make"]]
Output: [null, false, true, false, true]

Explanation:

validWordAbbr.isUnique("dear"); // return false, dictionary word "deer" and word "dear" have the same abbreviation
                                // "d2r" but are not the same.

"""295. Find Median from Data Stream (Hard)
Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list 
is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle 
value.

For example, [2,3,4], the median is 3; [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:
* void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data 
  structure.
* double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.

Example:
addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5

of a piece of food that the snake can eat. When a snake eats a piece of food, 
its length and the game's score both increase by 1. Each piece of food appears 
one by one on the screen, meaning the second piece of food will not appear 
until the snake eats the first piece of food. When a piece of food appears on 
the screen, it is guaranteed that it will not appear on a block occupied by the

Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 
minutes. Each function accepts a timestamp parameter (in seconds granularity)

order (ie, the timestamp is monotonically increasing). You may assume that the 
earliest timestamp starts at 1. It is possible that several hits arrive roughly 
at the same time.

Example:
HitCounter counter = new HitCounter();

// hit at timestamp 1.

// hit at timestamp 3.
counter.hit(3);

// get hits at timestamp 4, should return 3.

"""729. My Calendar I (Medium)
Implement a MyCalendar class to store your events. A new event can be added if 
adding the event will not cause a double booking. Your class will have the 
method, book(int start, int end). Formally, this represents a booking on the 
half open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that 
start <= x < end. A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty 
intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to both events.) For each 
call to the method MyCalendar.book, return true if the event can be added to 
the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return 
false and do not add the event to the calendar. Your class will be called like 
this: MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar(); MyCalendar.book(start, end)

Example 1:
MyCalendar();
MyCalendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(15, 25); // returns false
MyCalendar.book(20, 30); // returns true
Explanation: 
The first event can be booked. The second can't because time 15 is already 
booked by another event. The third event can be booked, as the first event 
takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.

Note:
* The number of calls to MyCalendar.book per test case will be at most 1000.
* In calls to MyCalendar.book(start, end), start and end are integers in the 
  range [0, 10^9].

Votes cast at time t will count towards our query.  In the case of a tie, the 
most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.

"""1656. Design an Ordered Stream (Easy)
There are n (id, value) pairs, where id is an integer between 1 and n and value
