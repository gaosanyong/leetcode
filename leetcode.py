    """8. String to Integer (atoi) (Medium)
	Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer. The function first 
	discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-
	whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes 
	an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits 
	as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value. The string can 
	contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, 
	which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function. If 
	the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid 
	integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty 
	or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed. If 
	no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

	Note:

	Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
	Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers 
	within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. If the numerical 
	value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or 
	INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

	Example 1:
	Input: "42"
	Output: 42

	Example 2:
	Input: "   -42"
	Output: -42
	Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
	             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.

	Example 3:
	Input: "4193 with words"
	Output: 4193
	Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.

	Example 4:
	Input: "words and 987"
	Output: 0
	Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical 
	             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.

	Example 5:
	Input: "-91283472332"
	Output: -2147483648
	Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

    """71. Simplify Path (Medium)
	Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other 
	words, convert it to the canonical path. In a UNIX-style file system, a 
	period . refers to the current directory. Furthermore, a double period .. 
	moves the directory up a level. Note that the returned canonical path must 
	always begin with a slash /, and there must be only a single slash / 
	between two directory names. The last directory name (if it exists) must 
	not end with a trailing /. Also, the canonical path must be the shortest 
	string representing the absolute path.

	Example 1:
	Input: "/home/"
	Output: "/home"
	Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory 
	             name.

	Example 2:
	Input: "/../"
	Output: "/"
	Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the 
	             root level is the highest level you can go.

	Example 3:
	Input: "/home//foo/"
	Output: "/home/foo"
	Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are 
	             replaced by a single one.

	Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it

	 / \    /  \
	g   r  e   at
	           / \
	          a   t
	
	To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two 
	children. For example, if we choose the node "gr" and swap its two 
	children, it produces a scrambled string "rgeat".

	    rgeat
	   /    \

	 / \    /  \
	r   g  e   at
	           / \
	          a   t
	
	We say that "rgeat" is a scrambled string of "great". Similarly, if we 
	continue to swap the children of nodes "eat" and "at", it produces a 
	scrambled string "rgtae".

    """134. Gas Station (Medium)
	There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at 
	station i is gas[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs 
	cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You 
	begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. Return the 
	starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in 
	the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

	Note:
	* If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
	* Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
	* Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

	Example 1:
	Input: gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
	       cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

	Explanation: Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. 
	             Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
	             Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8

    """157. Read N Characters Given Read4 (Easy)
	Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given 
	method read4, implement a method to read n characters. 
	 
	Method read4:
	The API read4 reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes 
	those characters into the buffer array buf4. The return value is the number 
	of actual characters read. Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much 
	like FILE *fp in C.

	Definition of read4:
	    Parameter:  char[] buf4
	    Returns:    int
	Note: buf4[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be 
	      copied to buf4[]

	Below is a high level example of how read4 works:
	File file("abcde"); // File is "abcde", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
	char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
	read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
	read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 = "e", fp points to end of file
	read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 = "", fp points to end of file

	Method read:
	By using the read4 method, implement the method read that reads n 
	characters from the file and store it in the buffer array buf. Consider 
	that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The return value is the 
	number of actual characters read.

	Definition of read:
	    Parameters:	char[] buf, int n
	    Returns:	int
	Note: buf[] is destination not source, you will need to write the results to buf[]

	Example 1:

	Input: file = "abc", n = 4
	Output: 3
	Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abc". We 
	             read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3. Note 
	             that "abc" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the 
	             destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

	Example 2:
	Input: file = "abcde", n = 5
	Output: 5
	Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abcde". We 
	             read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

	Example 3:
	Input: file = "abcdABCD1234", n = 12
	Output: 12
	Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abcdABCD1234". 
	             We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.
	
	Example 4:
	Input: file = "leetcode", n = 5
	Output: 5
	Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "leetc". We 
	             read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

	Note:
	* Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly, the file is only 
	  accesible for read4 but not for read.
	* The read function will only be called once for each test case.
	* You may assume the destination buffer array, buf, is guaranteed to have

	Buildings Skyline Contour
	The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of

	and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It 
	is guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. 
	You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an 
	absolutely flat surface at height 0. For instance, the dimensions of all 
	buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], 
	[15 20 10], [19 24 8] ]. The output is a list of "key points" (red dots in 
	Figure B) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that 
	uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a 
	horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the rightmost 
	building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and 
	always has zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent 
	buildings should be considered part of the skyline contour. For instance, 
	the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], 
	[12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].

	Notes:
	The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range 
	[0, 10000]. The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left 
	x position Li. The output list must be sorted by the x position. There must 
	be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. 
	For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable;

	According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply 
	as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John 
	Horton Conway in 1970."

	Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or
	dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, 
	vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above 
	Wikipedia article):

	* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
	* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
	* Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
	* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
	
	Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board 
	given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above 
	rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and 
	deaths occur simultaneously.

	Example:
	Input: 
	[
	  [0,1,0],
	  [0,0,1],
	  [1,1,1],
	  [0,0,0]

	  [1,0,1],
	  [0,1,1],
	  [0,1,0]
	]

	Follow up:
	* Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated 
	  at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their 
	  updated values to update other cells.
	* In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, 
	  the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area 
	  encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?"""

	For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string 
	"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", where # represents a null node. Given a string

	A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences 
	between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and 
	negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or 
	negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle 
	sequence. For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the 
	differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. In 
	contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle sequences, the first 
	because its first two differences are positive and the second because its 
	last difference is zero. Given a sequence of integers, return the length of 
	the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is 
	obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from 
	the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original

	Note:
	* The number of words given is at least 1 and does not exceed 500.

	Example 2:

	             11--12--NULL
	The serialization of each level is as follows:
	[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
	[7,8,9,10,null]
	[11,12,null]
	To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify 
	no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization 
	becomes:
	[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
	[null,null,7,8,9,10,null]
	[null,11,12,null]
	Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

    """451. Sort Characters By Frequency (Medium)
	Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the 
	characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears 
	in the string. Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, 
	return any of them.

	Example 1:
	Input: s = "tree"
	Output: "eert"
	Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once. So 'e' 
	             must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also 
	             a valid answer.
	
	Example 2:
	Input: s = "cccaaa"
	Output: "aaaccc"
	Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and 
	             "aaaccc" are valid answers. Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, 
	             as the same characters must be together.
	
	Example 3:

    """502. IPO (Hard)
	Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of 
	its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects 
	to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it 
	can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode 
	design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k 
	distinct projects. You are given n projects where the ith project has a 
	pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to 
	start it. Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you 
	will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total 
	capital. Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to 
	maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital. The 
	answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

	Example 1:
	Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
	Output: 4
	Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the 
	             project indexed 0. After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 
	             and your capital becomes 1. With capital 1, you can either

	The boundary of a binary tree is the concatenation of the root, the left 
	boundary, the leaves ordered from left-to-right, and the reverse order of 
	the right boundary. The left boundary is the set of nodes defined by the 
	following:
	* The root node's left child is in the left boundary. If the root does not 
	  have a left child, then the left boundary is empty.
	* If a node in the left boundary and has a left child, then the left child 
	  is in the left boundary.
	* If a node is in the left boundary, has no left child, but has a right 
	  child, then the right child is in the left boundary.
	* The leftmost leaf is not in the left boundary.
	The right boundary is similar to the left boundary, except it is the right 
	side of the root's right subtree. Again, the leaf is not part of the right 
	boundary, and the right boundary is empty if the root does not have a right 
	child. The leaves are nodes that do not have any children. For this problem, 
	the root is not a leaf. Given the root of a binary tree, return the values 
	of its boundary.

	Example 1:
	Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4]

	Explanation: - The left boundary follows the path starting from the root's

	Given n processes, each process has a unique PID (process id) and its PPID

	one or more children processes. This is just like a tree structure. Only 
	one process has PPID that is 0, which means this process has no parent

	Now given the two lists, and a PID representing a process you want to kill,

    """639. Decode Ways II (Hard)
	A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the 
	following mapping:
	'A' -> "1"
	'B' -> "2"
	...
	'Z' -> "26"
	To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped 
	back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be 
	multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:
	* "AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
	* "KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)
	Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped 
	into 'F' since "6" is different from "06". In addition to the mapping above, 
	an encoded message may contain the '*' character, which can represent any 
	digit from '1' to '9' ('0' is excluded). For example, the encoded message 
	"1*" may represent any of the encoded messages "11", "12", "13", "14", "15", 
	"16", "17", "18", or "19". Decoding "1*" is equivalent to decoding any of 
	the encoded messages it can represent. Given a string s consisting of 
	digits and '*' characters, return the number of ways to decode it. Since 
	the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

	Example 1:
	Input: s = "*"
	Output: 9
	Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages 
	             "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", or "9". Each of these 
	             can be decoded to the strings "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", 
	             "G", "H", and "I" respectively. Hence, there are a total of 9 
	             ways to decode "*".
	
	Example 2:
	Input: s = "1*"
	Output: 18
	Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages 
	             "11", "12", "13", "14", "15", "16", "17", "18", or "19". Each 
	             of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g. "11" 
	             can be decoded to "AA" or "K"). Hence, there are a total of 
	             9 * 2 = 18 ways to decode "1*".
	
	Example 3:
	Input: s = "2*"
	Output: 15
	Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages 
	             "21", "22", "23", "24", "25", "26", "27", "28", or "29". "21",

    """688. Knight Probability in Chessboard (Medium)
	On an NxN chessboard, a knight starts at the r-th row and c-th column and 
	attempts to make exactly K moves. The rows and columns are 0 indexed, so 
	the top-left square is (0, 0), and the bottom-right square is (N-1, N-1). A 
	chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each 
	move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an 
	orthogonal direction. Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of 
	eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off 
	the chessboard) and moves there. The knight continues moving until it has 
	made exactly K moves or has moved off the chessboard. Return the 
	probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped 
	moving.

	Example:
	Input: 3, 2, 0, 0
	Output: 0.0625
	Explanation: There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the 
	             knight on the board. From each of those positions, there are 
	             also two moves that will keep the knight on the board. The

	Given a Circular Linked List node, which is sorted in ascending order,

	Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an 
	array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. 
	This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by 
	the newline character '\n'. In C++, there are two types of comments, line 
	comments, and block comments.
	* The string "//" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the 
	  rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be 
	  ignored.
	* The string "/*" denotes a block comment, which represents that all 
	  characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of "*/" should be 
	  ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from 
	  left to right.) To be clear, the string "/*/" does not yet end the block 
	  comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.
	
	The first effective comment takes precedence over others.
	* For example, if the string "//" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.
	* Similarly, if the string "/*" occurs in a line or block comment, it is 
	  also ignored.
	If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not 
	output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty. There 
	will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.
	* For example, source = "string s = "/* Not a comment. */";" will not be a 
	  test case.
	Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the 
	comments. It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be 
	closed, so "/*" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new 
	comment. Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block 
	comments. Please see the examples below for details. After removing the 
	comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.

	Example 1:
	Input: source = ["/*Test program */",

	Given a (singly) linked list with head node root, write a function to split 
	the linked list into k consecutive linked list "parts". The length of each 
	part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size 
	differing by more than 1. This may lead to some parts being null. The parts 
	should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring 
	earlier should always have a size greater than or equal parts occurring 
	later. Return a List of ListNode's representing the linked list parts that 
	are formed. Examples 1->2->3->4, k = 5 // 5 equal parts [ [1], [2], [3], [4], null ]

	Example 1:
	Input: root = [1, 2, 3], k = 5
	Output: [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]
	Explanation: The input and each element of the output are ListNodes, not 
	arrays. For example, the input root has root.val = 1, root.next.val = 2, 
	root.next.next.val = 3, and root.next.next.next = null. The first element 
	output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null. The last element 
	output[4] is null, but it's string representation as a ListNode is [].
	
	Example 2:
	Input: root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], k = 3
	Output: [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]
	Explanation: The input has been split into consecutive parts with size 
	difference at most 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later 
	parts.
	
	Note:
	* The length of root will be in the range [0, 1000].

	Given the root of a binary tree where every node has a unique value and a

	leaf if it has no children.

	Example 1:
	Input: root = [1,3,2], k = 1

	Given a string licensePlate and an array of strings words, find the

	licensePlate, and treat letters as case insensitive. If a letter appears 
	more than once in licensePlate, then it must appear in the word the same 
	number of times or more. For example, if licensePlate = "aBc 12c", then it 
	contains letters 'a', 'b' (ignoring case), and 'c' twice. Possible 
	completing words are "abccdef", "caaacab", and "cbca". Return the shortest 
	completing word in words. It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are 
	multiple shortest completing words, return the first one that occurs in 
	words.

	Example 1:
	Input: licensePlate = "1s3 PSt", 
	       words = ["step","steps","stripe","stepple"]
	Output: "steps"
	Explanation: licensePlate contains letters 's', 'p', 's' (ignoring case),

	             "steps" contains 't', 'p', and both 's' characters. "stripe" 
	             is missing an 's'. "stepple" is missing an 's'. Since "steps" 
	             is the only word containing all the letters, that is the 
	             answer.
	
	Example 2:
	Input: licensePlate = "1s3 456", 
	       words = ["looks","pest","stew","show"]
	Output: "pest"
	Explanation: licensePlate only contains the letter 's'. All the words 
	             contain 's', but among these "pest", "stew", and "show" are 
	             shortest. The answer is "pest" because it is the word that 
	             appears earliest of the 3.
	
	Example 3:
	Input: licensePlate = "Ah71752", 
	       words = ["suggest","letter","of","husband","easy","education","drug","prevent","writer","old"]

	You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10

    """755. Pour Water (Medium)
	You are given an elevation map represents as an integer array heights where 
	heights[i] representing the height of the terrain at index i. The width at 
	each index is 1. You are also given two integers volume and k. volume units 
	of water will fall at index k. Water first drops at the index k and rests 
	on top of the highest terrain or water at that index. Then, it flows 
	according to the following rules:
	* If the droplet would eventually fall by moving left, then move left.
	* Otherwise, if the droplet would eventually fall by moving right, then 
	  move right.
	* Otherwise, rise to its current position.
	Here, "eventually fall" means that the droplet will eventually be at a 
	lower level if it moves in that direction. Also, level means the height of 
	the terrain plus any water in that column. We can assume there is 
	infinitely high terrain on the two sides out of bounds of the array. Also, 
	there could not be partial water being spread out evenly on more than one 
	grid block, and each unit of water has to be in exactly one block.

	Example 1:
	Input: heights = [2,1,1,2,1,2,2], volume = 4, k = 3
	Output: [2,2,2,3,2,2,2]
	Explanation: The first drop of water lands at index k = 3. When moving left 
	             or right, the water can only move to the same level or a lower 
	             level. (By level, we mean the total height of the terrain plus 
	             any water in that column.) Since moving left will eventually 
	             make it fall, it moves left. (A droplet "made to fall" means 
	             go to a lower height than it was at previously.) Since moving 
	             left will not make it fall, it stays in place. The next 
	             droplet falls at index k = 3. Since the new droplet moving 
	             left will eventually make it fall, it moves left. Notice that 
	             the droplet still preferred to move left, even though it could 
	             move right (and moving right makes it fall quicker.) The third 
	             droplet falls at index k = 3. Since moving left would not 
	             eventually make it fall, it tries to move right. Since moving 
	             right would eventually make it fall, it moves right. Finally, 
	             the fourth droplet falls at index k = 3. Since moving left 
	             would not eventually make it fall, it tries to move right. 
	             Since moving right would not eventually make it fall, it stays 
	             in place.

	Example 2:
	Input: heights = [1,2,3,4], volume = 2, k = 2
	Output: [2,3,3,4]
	Explanation: The last droplet settles at index 1, since moving further left 
	             would not cause it to eventually fall to a lower height.

	hits[i] = (rowi, coli). The brick on that location (if it exists) will 
	disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that 
	erasure and will fall. Once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from 
	the grid (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks). Return an array

	routes[0] = [1, 5, 7], this means that the 0th bus travels in the sequence 
	1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> ... forever. You will start at the bus 
	stop source (You are not on any bus initially), and you want to go to the 
	bus stop target. You can travel between bus stops by buses only. Return the 
	least number of buses you must take to travel from source to target. Return 
	-1 if it is not possible.

	Example 1:
	Input: routes = [[1,2,7],[3,6,7]], source = 1, target = 6
	Output: 2
	Explanation: The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7,

    """831. Masking Personal Information (Medium)
	We are given a personal information string S, which may represent either an 
	email address or a phone number. We would like to mask this personal 
	information according to the following rules:

	1. Email address:
	We define a name to be a string of length ≥ 2 consisting of only lowercase 
	letters a-z or uppercase letters A-Z. An email address starts with a name, 
	followed by the symbol '@', followed by a name, followed by the dot '.' and 
	followed by a name. All email addresses are guaranteed to be valid and in 
	the format of "name1@name2.name3". To mask an email, all names must be 
	converted to lowercase and all letters between the first and last letter of 
	the first name must be replaced by 5 asterisks '*'.

	2. Phone number:
	A phone number is a string consisting of only the digits 0-9 or the 
	characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '}. You may assume a phone 
	number contains 10 to 13 digits. The last 10 digits make up the local 
	number, while the digits before those make up the country code. Note that 
	the country code is optional. We want to expose only the last 4 digits and 
	mask all other digits. The local number should be formatted and masked as 
	"***-***-1111", where 1 represents the exposed digits. To mask a phone 
	number with country code like "+111 111 111 1111", we write it in the form 
	"+***-***-***-1111".  The '+' sign and the first '-' sign before the local 
	number should only exist if there is a country code.  For example, a 12 
	digit phone number mask should start with "+**-". Note that extraneous 
	characters like "(", ")", " ", as well as extra dashes or plus signs not 
	part of the above formatting scheme should be removed.

	Return the correct "mask" of the information provided.

	Example 1:
	Input: "LeetCode@LeetCode.com"
	Output: "l*****e@leetcode.com"
	Explanation: All names are converted to lowercase, and the letters between 
	             the first and last letter of the first name is replaced by 5 
	             asterisks. Therefore, "leetcode" -> "l*****e".

	Example 2:
	Input: "AB@qq.com"
	Output: "a*****b@qq.com"
	Explanation: There must be 5 asterisks between the first and last letter 
	             of the first name "ab". Therefore, "ab" -> "a*****b".
	
	Example 3:
	Input: "1(234)567-890"
	Output: "***-***-7890"
	Explanation: 10 digits in the phone number, which means all digits make up 
	             the local number.

	Example 4:
	Input: "86-(10)12345678"
	Output: "+**-***-***-5678"
	Explanation: 12 digits, 2 digits for country code and 10 digits for local

    """832. Flipping an Image (Easy)
	Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then 
	invert it, and return the resulting image. To flip an image horizontally 
	means that each row of the image is reversed.  For example, flipping 
	[1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1]. To invert an image means that 
	each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0. For example, 
	inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0].

	Example 1:
	Input: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
	Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
	Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]. Then,

    """833. Find And Replace in String (Medium)
	To some string S, we will perform some replacement operations that replace 
	groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size). Each 
	replacement operation has 3 parameters: a starting index i, a source word x 
	and a target word y.  The rule is that if x starts at position i in the 
	original string S, then we will replace that occurrence of x with y.  If 
	not, we do nothing. For example, if we have S = "abcd" and we have some 
	replacement operation i = 2, x = "cd", y = "ffff", then because "cd" starts 
	at position 2 in the original string S, we will replace it with "ffff". 
	Using another example on S = "abcd", if we have both the replacement 
	operation i = 0, x = "ab", y = "eee", as well as another replacement 
	operation i = 2, x = "ec", y = "ffff", this second operation does nothing 
	because in the original string S[2] = 'c', which doesn't match x[0] = 'e'. 
	All these operations occur simultaneously.  

	It's guaranteed that there won't be any overlap in replacement: for example, 
	S = "abc", indexes = [0, 1], sources = ["ab","bc"] is not a valid test case.

	Example 1:
	Input: S = "abcd", indexes = [0, 2], sources = ["a", "cd"], targets = ["eee", "ffff"]
	Output: "eeebffff"
	Explanation: "a" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee".
	             "cd" starts at index 2 in S, so it's replaced by "ffff".

	Example 2:
	Input: S = "abcd", indexes = [0, 2], sources = ["ab","ec"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]
	Output: "eeecd"
	Explanation: "ab" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee".
	             "ec" doesn't starts at index 2 in the original S, so we do nothing.

	Given the root of a binary tree, the depth of each node is the shortest

	A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target 
	miles east of the starting position. Along the way, there are gas stations.  
	Each station[i] represents a gas station that is station[i][0] miles east 
	of the starting position, and has station[i][1] liters of gas. The car 
	starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters 
	of fuel in it.  It uses 1 liter of gas per 1 mile that it drives. When the 
	car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas 
	from the station into the car. What is the least number of refueling stops 
	the car must make in order to reach its destination?  If it cannot reach 
	the destination, return -1. Note that if the car reaches a gas station with

	and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break. Each move, you may 
	take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If 
	the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not 
	break, you may reuse it in future moves. Return the minimum number of moves 
	that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

	Example 1:
	Input: k = 1, n = 2
	Output: 2
	Explanation: Drop the egg from floor 1. If it breaks, we know that f = 0.
	             Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2. If it breaks, we know 
	             that f = 1. If it does not break, then we know f = 2. Hence,

    """973. K Closest Points to Origin (Medium)
	Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on 
	the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin 
	(0, 0). The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean 
	distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2). You may return the answer in 
	any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that 
	it is in).

	Example 1:
	Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
	Output: [[-2,2]]
	Explanation: The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10). The 
	             distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8). Since 
	             sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin. We only 
	             want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer 
	             is just [[-2,2]].
	
	Example 2:
	Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2

    """975. Odd Even Jump (Hard)
	You are given an integer array arr. From some starting index, you can make 
	a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called 
	odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are 
	called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the 
	indices. You may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the 
	following way:
	* During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the 
	  index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible 
	  value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the 
	  smallest such index j.
	* During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the 
	  index j such that arr[i] >= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible 
	  value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the 
	  smallest such index j.
	* It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.
	A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the 
	end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times 
	(possibly 0 or more than once). Return the number of good starting indices.

	Example 1:
	Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]
	Output: 2
	Explanation: From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.
	             From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.
	             From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.
	             From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.
	             In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and 
	             i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.
	
	Example 2:
	Input: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]
	Output: 3
	Explanation: From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:
	             During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].
	             During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3
	             During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].
	             We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 
	             is not good. In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
	             From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
	             From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.
	             From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
	             From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.
	             In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, 
	             and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.

    """1055. Shortest Way to Form String (Medium)
	A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original

	subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). Given two strings source and

	concatenation equals target. If the task is impossible, return -1.

	Example 1:
	Input: source = "abc", target = "abcbc"

	Explanation: The target "abcbc" can be formed by "abc" and "bc", which are 
	             subsequences of source "abc".
	
	Example 2:
	Input: source = "abc", target = "acdbc"
	Output: -1
	Explanation: The target string cannot be constructed from the subsequences

	an array bikes of length m where bikes[j] = [xj, yj] is the position of the 
	jth bike. All the given positions are unique. Assign a bike to each worker. 
	Among the available bikes and workers, we choose the (workeri, bikej) pair 
	with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other and assign the bike 
	to that worker. If there are multiple (workeri, bikej) pairs with the same 
	shortest Manhattan distance, we choose the pair with the smallest worker 
	index. If there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the pair with the 
	smallest bike index. Repeat this process until there are no available

	You are given two strings of the same length s1 and s2 and a string baseStr.
	We say s1[i] and s2[i] are equivalent characters.
	* For example, if s1 = "abc" and s2 = "cde", then we have 'a' == 'c', 
	  'b' == 'd', and 'c' == 'e'.
	Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:
	* Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'.
	* Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'.
	* Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'.
	For example, given the equivalency information from s1 = "abc" and 
	s2 = "cde", "acd" and "aab" are equivalent strings of baseStr = "eed", and 
	"aab" is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr. 
	Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr by using 
	the equivalency information from s1 and s2.

	Example 1:
	Input: s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris", baseStr = "parser"

	Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can

	             characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in 
	             lexicographical order. So the answer is "makkek".
	
	Example 2:
	Input: s1 = "hello", s2 = "world", baseStr = "hold"
	Output: "hdld"
	Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can 
	             group their characters as [h,w], [d,e,o], [l,r]. So only the 
	             second letter 'o' in baseStr is changed to 'd', the answer is 
	             "hdld".
	
	Example 3:
	Input: s1 = "leetcode", s2 = "programs", baseStr = "sourcecode"
	Output: "aauaaaaada"
	Explanation: We group the equivalent characters in s1 and s2 as 
	             [a,o,e,r,s,c], [l,p], [g,t] and [d,m], thus all letters in 
	             baseStr except 'u' and 'd' are transformed to 'a', the answer

	On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are n workers and m bikes, with 
	n <= m. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid. We assign one 
	unique bike to each worker so that the sum of the Manhattan distances 
	between each worker and their assigned bike is minimized. Return the 
	minimum possible sum of Manhattan distances between each worker and their 
	assigned bike. The Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is 
	Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|.

	Example 1:
	Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
	Output: 6
	Explanation: We assign bike 0 to worker 0, bike 1 to worker 1. The 
	             Manhattan distance of both assignments is 3, so the output is

	             worker 1 or worker 2, bike 2 to worker 2 or worker 1. Both 
	             assignments lead to sum of the Manhattan distances as 4.

	Under a grammar given below, strings can represent a set of lowercase words.

	* Single letters represent a singleton set containing that word.

	  + R("w") = {"w"}
	* When we take a comma delimited list of 2 or more expressions, we take the

	  + R("{{a,b},{b,c}}") = {"a","b","c"} (notice the final set only contains

	* For example, ["home", "away", "love"], ["leetcode", "love", "leetcode"],

	The power of an integer x is defined as the number of steps needed to 
	transform x into 1 using the following steps:
	* if x is even then x = x / 2
	* if x is odd then x = 3 * x + 1
	For example, the power of x = 3 is 7 because 3 needs 7 steps to become 1 
	(3 --> 10 --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1). Given three integers lo, 
	hi and k. The task is to sort all integers in the interval [lo, hi] by the 
	power value in ascending order, if two or more integers have the same power 
	value sort them by ascending order. Return the k-th integer in the range 
	[lo, hi] sorted by the power value. Notice that for any integer x 
	(lo <= x <= hi) it is guaranteed that x will transform into 1 using these 
	steps and that the power of x is will fit in 32 bit signed integer.

	Example 1:
	Input: lo = 12, hi = 15, k = 2

	Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several 
	stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is 
	an integer given in the array stoneValue. Alice and Bob take turns, with 
	Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2 or 3 
	stones from the first remaining stones in the row. The score of each player 
	is the sum of values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 
	initially. The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and 
	the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. 
	The game continues until all the stones have been taken. Assume Alice and 
	Bob play optimally. Return "Alice" if Alice will win, "Bob" if Bob will win 
	or "Tie" if they end the game with the same score.

	Example 1:
	Input: values = [1,2,3,7]
	Output: "Bob"
	Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three 
	             piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and 
	             Bob wins.

	Example 2:
	Input: values = [1,2,3,-9]
	Output: "Alice"
	Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win 
	             and leave Bob with negative score. If Alice chooses one pile 
	             her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. 
	             The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and 
	             lose. If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the 
	             next move Bob's score becomes 3. The next move Alice will take 
	             the pile with value = -9 and also lose. Remember that both 
	             play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that 
	             makes her win.
	
	Example 3:

	You are given all the nodes of an N-ary tree as an array of Node objects,

	Custom testing: An N-ary tree can be serialized as represented in its level

	(see examples). For example, the above tree is serialized as 
	[1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14].

	The testing will be done in the following way:
	* The input data should be provided as a serialization of the tree.
	* The driver code will construct the tree from the serialized input data 
	  and put each Node object into an array in an arbitrary order.
	* The driver code will pass the array to findRoot, and your function should 
	  find and return the root Node object in the array.
	* The driver code will take the returned Node object and serialize it. If

	             arbitrary order. For example, the passed array could be 
	             [Node(5),Node(4),Node(3),Node(6),Node(2),Node(1)] or 
	             [Node(2),Node(6),Node(1),Node(3),Node(5),Node(4)]. The 
	             findRoot function should return the root Node(1), and the 
	             driver code will serialize it and compare with the input data.
	             The input data and serialized Node(1) are the same, so the 
	             test passes.

	Given a string s of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number

	* The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings s[i..j] and 
	  s[k..l], either j < k or i > l is true.
	* A substring that contains a certain character c must also contain all 
	  occurrences of c.
	Find the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If 
	there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the 
	one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique 
	solution of minimum total length. Notice that you can return the substrings 
	in any order.

	Example 1:
	Input: s = "adefaddaccc"
	Output: ["e","f","ccc"]
	Explanation: The following are all the possible substrings that meet the 
	             conditions: ["adefaddaccc"

	             If we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else 
	             and we'd get only 1. If we choose "adefadda", we are left with 
	             "ccc" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus 
	             obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to 
	             choose "ef" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the 
	             optimal way is to choose ["e","f","ccc"] which gives us 3 
	             substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings

	need to delete at most k characters from s such that the run-length encoded 
	version of s has minimum length. Find the minimum length of the run-length 
	encoded version of s after deleting at most k characters.

	Example 1:
	Input: s = "aaabcccd", k = 2
	Output: 4
	Explanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us "a3bc3d" 
	             of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would 
	             at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for 
	             instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = "abcccd" which 
	             compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 
	             'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be "a3c3" 
	             of length 4.

	Example 2:
	Input: s = "aabbaa", k = 2
	Output: 2
	Explanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed 
	             string would be "a4" of length 2.
	
	Example 3:
	Input: s = "aaaaaaaaaaa", k = 0
	Output: 3
	Explanation: Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything. The compressed 
	             string is "a11" of length 3.

	We have an integer array arr, where all the integers in arr are equal

	will not be given direct access to the array, instead, you will have an API 
	ArrayReader which have the following functions:
	* int compareSub(int l, int r, int x, int y): where 
	  0 <= l, r, x, y < ArrayReader.length(), l <= r and x <= y. The function 
	  compares the sum of sub-array arr[l..r] with the sum of the sub-array 
	  arr[x..y] and returns:
	  - 1 if arr[l]+arr[l+1]+...+arr[r] > arr[x]+arr[x+1]+...+arr[y].

	  number that is smaller than other numbers?

	Example 1:
	Input: arr = [7,7,7,7,10,7,7,7]
	Output: 4
	Explanation: The following calls to the API
	reader.compareSub(0, 0, 1, 1) // returns 0 this is a query comparing the 
	                              // sub-array (0, 0) with the sub array (1, 1), 
	                              // (i.e. compares arr[0] with arr[1]).
	Thus we know that arr[0] and arr[1] doesn't contain the largest element.
	reader.compareSub(2, 2, 3, 3) // returns 0, we can exclude arr[2] and arr[3].
	reader.compareSub(4, 4, 5, 5) // returns 1, thus for sure arr[4] is the

	2) Once the printer has used a color for the above operation, the same

	All of the servers start out available.
	The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.
	Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.
	Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.
	Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.

	Example 2:
	Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]
	Output: [0]
	Explanation:
	The first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.
	Request 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.
	Server 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each. Hence server 0 is the busiest server.

	Example 3:
	Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3], load = [10,12,11]
	Output: [0,1,2]
	Explanation: Each server handles a single request, so they are all considered the busiest.

	You are given an array nums of non-negative integers. nums is considered

	You are given a string s of even length consisting of digits from 0 to 9,

	operations any number of times and in any order on s: 
	1) Add a to all odd indices of s (0-indexed). Digits post 9 are cycled back 
	   to 0. For example, if s = "3456" and a = 5, s becomes "3951".
	2) Rotate s to the right by b positions. For example, if s = "3456" and 
	   b = 1, s becomes "6345".

	smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where 
	a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet 
	than the corresponding letter in b. For example, "0158" is lexicographically 
	smaller than "0190" because the first position they differ is at the third

	answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is true if for the ith query, 
	there is a path between ai and bi, or answer[i] is false if there is no 
	path.

	Example 1:
	Input: n = 6, threshold = 2, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]

	Output: [true,true,true,true,true]
	Explanation: The divisors for each number are the same as the previous

	was released. Both arrays are 0-indexed. The 0th key was pressed at the 
	time 0, and every subsequent key was pressed at the exact time the previous 
	key was released. The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had 
	the longest duration. The ith keypress had a duration of 
	releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1], and the 0th keypress had a duration 
	of releaseTimes[0]. Note that the same key could have been pressed multiple

	Example 1:
	Input: releaseTimes = [9,29,49,50], keysPressed = "cbcd"

	Explanation: The keypresses were as follows:
	1) Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 9 (pressed at time 0 and released at 
	   time 9).
	2) Keypress for 'b' had a duration of 29 - 9 = 20 (pressed at time 9 right

	4) Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 50 - 49 = 1 (pressed at time 49 right 
	   after the release of the previous character and released at time 50).
	The longest of these was the keypress for 'b' and the second keypress for

	A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s 
	that have the same frequency. Given a string s, return the minimum number 
	of characters you need to delete to make s good. The frequency of a 
	character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For 
	example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the 
	frequency of 'b' is 1.

	transaction, there are only 5 yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is 
	then valued at 5 (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more 
	to the customer). You are given an integer array, inventory, where

	You have the task of delivering some boxes from storage to their ports

	and the total weight that it can carry. You are given an array boxes, where 
	boxes[i] = [portsi, weighti], and three integers portsCount, maxBoxes, and 
	maxWeight.
	* portsi is the port where you need to deliver the ith box and weightsi is 
	  the weight of the ith box.
	* portsCount is the number of ports.
	* maxBoxes and maxWeight are the respective box and weight limits of the 
	  ship.
	The boxes need to be delivered in the order they are given. The ship will 
	follow these steps:
	* The ship will take some number of boxes from the boxes queue, not 
	  violating the maxBoxes and maxWeight constraints.
	* For each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the 
	  box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at 
	  the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be 
	  delivered.

	             need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be

	Given n cuboids where the dimensions of the ith cuboid is 
	cuboids[i] = [widthi, lengthi, heighti] (0-indexed). Choose a subset of 
	cuboids and place them on each other. You can place cuboid i on cuboid j if 
	widthi <= widthj and lengthi <= lengthj and heighti <= heightj. You can 
	rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by rotating it to put it on another 
	cuboid. Return the maximum height of the stacked cuboids.

	Example 1:
	Input: cuboids = [[50,45,20],[95,37,53],[45,23,12]]
	Output: 190
	Explanation:
	Cuboid 1 is placed on the bottom with the 53x37 side facing down with height 95.
	Cuboid 0 is placed next with the 45x20 side facing down with height 50.
	Cuboid 2 is placed next with the 23x12 side facing down with height 45.

	You are given a phone number as a string number. number consists of digits,

	in a certain manner. Firstly, remove all spaces and dashes. Then, group the 
	digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until there are 4 or fewer 
	digits. The final digits are then grouped as follows:
	* 2 digits: A single block of length 2.
	* 3 digits: A single block of length 3.
	* 4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.
	The blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process 
	should never produce any blocks of length 1 and produce at most two blocks 
	of length 2. Return the phone number after formatting.

	Example 1:
	Input: number = "1-23-45 6"
	Output: "123-456"
	Explanation: The digits are "123456".
	Step 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is "123".
	Step 2: There are 3 digits remaining, so put them in a single block of length 3. The 2nd block is "456".

	Step 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is "123".
	Step 2: There are 4 digits left, so split them into two blocks of length 2. The blocks are "45" and "67".
	Joining the blocks gives "123-45-67".

	Example 3:
	Input: number = "123 4-5678"

	Given an integer n, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:

	* Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.
	* For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two 
	  occurrences of i is exactly i.
	The distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the 
	absolute difference of their indices, |j - i|. Return the lexicographically 
	largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there 
	is always a solution. A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a 
	sequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b 
	differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b. 
	For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because 
	the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater 
	than 5.

	There is a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) 
	consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 edges. 
	Each node has a value associated with it, and the root of the tree is node 
	0. To represent this tree, you are given an integer array nums and a 2D 
	array edges. Each nums[i] represents the ith node's value, and each 
	edges[j] = [uj, vj] represents an edge between nodes uj and vj in the tree. 
	Two values x and y are coprime if gcd(x, y) == 1 where gcd(x, y) is the 
	greatest common divisor of x and y. An ancestor of a node i is any other 
	node on the shortest path from node i to the root. A node is not considered

	  closest valid ancestor.
	- Node 3 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. It is coprime with node 1

    """1776. Car Fleet II (Hard)
	There are n cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along 
	a one-lane road. You are given an array cars of length n, where 
	cars[i] = [position_i, speed_i] represents:
	* positioni is the distance between the ith car and the beginning of the 
	  road in meters. It is guaranteed that position_i < position_{i+1}.
	* speedi is the initial speed of the ith car in meters per second.
	For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number 
	line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car 
	collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars 
	in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which 
	is the initial speed of the slowest car in the fleet. Return an array 
	answer, where answer[i] is the time, in seconds, at which the ith car 
	collides with the next car, or -1 if the car does not collide with the next 
	car. Answers within 10^-5 of the actual answers are accepted.

	Example 1:
	Input: cars = [[1,2],[2,1],[4,3],[7,2]]
	Output: [1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,-1.00000]
	Explanation: After exactly one second, the first car will collide with the 
	             second car, and form a car fleet with speed 1 m/s. After 
	             exactly 3 seconds, the third car will collide with the fourth

	placed before all orders represented by orders[i+1] for all valid i. There 
	is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The

	  price in the backlog. If that sell order's price is smaller than or equal 
	  to the current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and 
	  that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is

	- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.
	- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.
	- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.
	- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.
	Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.

	- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.
	- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.
	- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.
	Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).

    """1807. Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String (Medium)
	You are given a string s that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair 
	containing a non-empty key. 
	* For example, in the string "(name)is(age)yearsold", there are two bracket 
	  pairs that contain the keys "name" and "age".
	You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D 
	string array knowledge where each knowledge[i] = [keyi, valuei] indicates 
	that key keyi has a value of valuei. You are tasked to evaluate all of the 
	bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some key keyi, 
	you will:
	* Replace keyi and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding valuei.
	* If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace keyi and the 
	  bracket pair with a question mark "?" (without the quotation marks).
	Each key will appear at most once in your knowledge. There will not be any

	Example 3:
	Input: s = "(a)(a)(a)aaa", knowledge = [["a","yes"]]
	Output: "yesyesyesaaa"
	Explanation: The same key can appear multiple times.
	The key "a" has a value of "yes", so replace all occurrences of "(a)" with "yes".

	There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a

	friend. The rules of the game are as follows:
	* Start at the 1st friend.
	* Count the next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend 
	  you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some 
	  friends more than once.
	* The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
	* If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 
	  starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just 
	  lost and repeat.
	* Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.

    """1884. Egg Drop With 2 Eggs and N Floors (Medium)
	You are given two identical eggs and you have access to a building with n 
	floors labeled from 1 to n. You know that there exists a floor f where 
	0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, 
	and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break. In each move, you 
	may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). 
	If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not 
	break, you may reuse it in future moves. Return the minimum number of moves 
	that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

	Example 1:
	Input: n = 2
	Output: 2
	Explanation: We can drop the first egg from floor 1 and the second egg from floor 2.

	             If the second egg breaks but the first egg didn't, we know that f = 1.

	Example 2:
	Input: n = 100
	Output: 14
	Explanation: One optimal strategy is:
	- Drop the 1st egg at floor 9. If it breaks, we know f is between 0 and 8. 
	  Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 1 and going up one at a time to find 
	  f within 7 more drops. Total drops is 1 + 7 = 8.
	- If the 1st egg does not break, drop the 1st egg again at floor 22. If it 
	  breaks, we know f is between 9 and 21. Drop the 2nd egg starting from 
	  floor 10 and going up one at a time to find f within 12 more drops. Total 
	  drops is 2 + 12 = 14.
	- If the 1st egg does not break again, follow a similar process dropping 
	  the 1st egg from floors 34, 45, 55, 64, 72, 79, 85, 90, 94, 97, 99, and

	You are given a valid boolean expression as a string expression consisting

	while "1", "(((1))|(0))", and "1|(0&(1))" are valid expressions. Return the 
	minimum cost to change the final value of the expression. For example, if 
	expression = "1|1|(0&0)&1", its value is 1|1|(0&0)&1 = 1|1|0&1 = 1|0&1 = 1&1 = 1. 
	We want to apply operations so that the new expression evaluates to 0. The 
	cost of changing the final value of an expression is the number of 
	operations performed on the expression. The types of operations are 
	described as follows:
	* Turn a '1' into a '0'.
	* Turn a '0' into a '1'.
	* Turn a '&' into a '|'.
	* Turn a '|' into a '&'.
	Note: '&' does not take precedence over '|' in the order of calculation. 
	Evaluate parentheses first, then in left-to-right order.

	Example 1:

	Example 2:
	Input: expression = "(0&0)&(0&0&0)"

	Explanation: We can turn "(0&0)&(0&0&0)" into "(0|1)|(0&0&0)" using 3

	Example 3:

	initial standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 
	2 is the second player in the row, etc.). The tournament consists of 
	multiple rounds (starting from round number 1). In each round, the ith

	end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number 
	of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle 
	automatically advances to the next round.

	* For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
	  - Player 1 competes against player 7.
	  - Player 2 competes against player 6.
	  - Player 4 automatically advances to the next round.
	After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on 
	the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order). The 
	players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the 
	tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete 
	against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, 
	either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round.

	* Replace num[i] with any digit between '0' and '9'.
	The game ends when there are no more '?' characters in num. For Bob to win,

	* Every node in the node's left subtree has a value strictly less than the 
	  node's value.
	* Every node in the node's right subtree has a value strictly greater than 
	  the node's value.
	A leaf is a node that has no children.

	Example 1:
	Input: trees = [[2,1],[3,2,5],[5,4]]
	Output: [3,2,5,1,null,4]
	Explanation: In the first operation, pick i=1 and j=0, and merge trees[0] 
	             into trees[1]. Delete trees[0], so trees = [[3,2,5,1],[5,4]].
	             In the second operation, pick i=0 and j=1, and merge trees[1] 
	             into trees[0]. Delete trees[1], so trees = [[3,2,5,1,null,4]].
	             The resulting tree is a valid BST, so return its root.
	
	Example 2:
	Input: trees = [[5,3,8],[3,2,6]]
	Output: []
	Explanation: Pick i=0 and j=1 and merge trees[1] into trees[0]. Delete 
	             trees[1], so trees = [[5,3,8,2,6]]. This is the only valid 
	             operation that can be performed, but the resulting tree is not 
	             a valid BST, so return null.
	
	Example 3:
	Input: trees = [[5,4],[3]]
	Output: []
	Explanation: It is impossible to perform any operations.

	Example 4:
	Input: trees = [[2,1,3]]
	Output: [2,1,3]
	Explanation: There is only one tree, and it is already a valid BST, so 
	             return its root.

    """1943. Describe the Painting (Medium)
	There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. 
	The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each 
	segment was painted with a unique color. You are given a 2D integer array 
	segments, where segments[i] = [starti, endi, colori] represents the half-
	closed segment [starti, endi) with colori as the color. The colors in the 
	overlapping segments of the painting were mixed when it was painted. When 
	two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a 
	set of mixed colors.

	* For example, if colors 2, 4, and 6 are mixed, then the resulting mixed 
	  color is {2,4,6}.
	For the sake of simplicity, you should only output the sum of the elements 
	in the set rather than the full set. You want to describe the painting with 
	the minimum number of non-overlapping half-closed segments of these mixed 
	colors. These segments can be represented by the 2D array painting where 
	painting[j] = [leftj, rightj, mixj] describes a half-closed segment 
	[leftj, rightj) with the mixed color sum of mixj.

	* For example, the painting created with segments = [[1,4,5],[1,7,7]] can 
	  be described by painting = [[1,4,12],[4,7,7]] because:
	  + [1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from both the first and 
	    second segments.
	  + [4,7) is colored {7} from only the second segment.
	Return the 2D array painting describing the finished painting (excluding 
	any parts that are not painted). You may return the segments in any order.
	A half-closed segment [a, b) is the section of the number line between 
	points a and b including point a and not including point b.

	Example 1:
	Input: segments = [[1,4,5],[4,7,7],[1,7,9]]
	Output: [[1,4,14],[4,7,16]]
	Explanation: The painting can be described as follows:
	             - [1,4) is colored {5,9} (with a sum of 14) from the first and third segments.
	             - [4,7) is colored {7,9} (with a sum of 16) from the second and third segments.

	Example 2:
	Input: segments = [[1,7,9],[6,8,15],[8,10,7]]
	Output: [[1,6,9],[6,7,24],[7,8,15],[8,10,7]]
	Explanation: The painting can be described as follows:
	             - [1,6) is colored 9 from the first segment.
	             - [6,7) is colored {9,15} (with a sum of 24) from the first and second segments.
	             - [7,8) is colored 15 from the second segment.
	             - [8,10) is colored 7 from the third segment.
	
	Example 3:
	Input: segments = [[1,4,5],[1,4,7],[4,7,1],[4,7,11]]
	Output: [[1,4,12],[4,7,12]]
	Explanation: The painting can be described as follows:
	             - [1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from the first and second segments.
	             - [4,7) is colored {1,11} (with a sum of 12) from the third and fourth segments.
	             Note that returning a single segment [1,7) is incorrect 
	             because the mixed color sets are different.

	You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, and an

	'z' with 26). Then, transform the integer by replacing it with the sum of 
	its digits. Repeat the transform operation k times in total. For example, 
	if s = "zbax" and k = 2, then the resulting integer would be 8 by the 
	following operations:
	* Convert: "zbax" ➝ "(26)(2)(1)(24)" ➝ "262124" ➝ 262124
	* Transform #1: 262124 ➝ 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 ➝ 17
	* Transform #2: 17 ➝ 1 + 7 ➝ 8
	Return the resulting integer after performing the operations described 
	above.

	Example 1:
	Input: s = "iiii", k = 1

	Explanation: Replace the substring "1":

	Example 2:

	Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are 
	given a 2D array paths, where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute

	* For example, ["one", "two", "three"] represents the path "/one/two/three".
	Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they 
	contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying 
	subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be 
	identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as 
	well as all their subfolders.

	* For example, folders "/a" and "/b" in the file structure below are 
	  identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:
	  - /a
	  - /a/x
	  - /a/x/y
	  - /a/z
	  - /b
	  - /b/x
	  - /b/x/y
	  - /b/z
	* However, if the file structure also included the path "/b/w", then the 
	  folders "/a" and "/b" would not be identical. Note that "/a/x" and "/b/x" 
	  would still be considered identical even with the added folder.
	Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the 
	file system will delete all of them. The file system only runs the deletion 
	once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are 
	not deleted. Return the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining 
	folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in

	Output: [["d"],["d","a"]]
	Explanation: Folders "/a" and "/c" (and their subfolders) are marked for

	Explanation: Folders "/a/b/x" and "/w" (and their subfolders) are marked

	             "y". Note that folders "/a" and "/c" are identical after the

	             marked beforehand.
	
	Example 3:
	Input: paths = [["a","b"],["c","d"],["c"],["a"]]
	Output: [["c"],["c","d"],["a"],["a","b"]]
	Explanation: All folders are unique in the file system. Note that the 
	             returned array can be in a different order as the order does 
	             not matter.
	
	Example 4:
	Input: paths = [["a"],["a","x"],["a","x","y"],["a","z"],["b"],["b","x"],["b","x","y"],["b","z"]]
	Output: []
	Explanation: Folders "/a/x" and "/b/x" (and their subfolders) are marked 
	             for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named 
	             "y". Folders "/a" and "/b" (and their subfolders) are marked 
	             for deletion because they both contain an empty folder "z" and

	Output: [["b"],["b","w"],["b","z"],["a"],["a","z"]]
	Explanation: This has the same structure as the previous example, except 
	             with the added "/b/w". Folders "/a/x" and "/b/x" are still 
	             marked, but "/a" and "/b" are no longer marked because "/b" 
	             has the empty folder named "w" and "/a" does not. Note that

    """1966. Binary Searchable Numbers in an Unsorted Array (Medium)
	Consider a function that implements an algorithm similar to Binary Search. 
	The function has two input parameters: sequence is a sequence of integers, 
	and target is an integer value. The purpose of the function is to find if 
	the target exists in the sequence. The pseudocode of the function is as 
	follows:

	func(sequence, target)
	  while sequence is not empty
	    randomly choose an element from sequence as the pivot
	    if pivot = target, return true
	    else if pivot < target, remove pivot and all elements to its left from the sequence
	    else, remove pivot and all elements to its right from the sequence
	  end while

	When the sequence is sorted, the function works correctly for all values. 
	When the sequence is not sorted, the function does not work for all values, 
	but may still work for some values. Given an integer array nums, 
	representing the sequence, that contains unique numbers and may or may not 
	be sorted, return the number of values that are guaranteed to be found 
	using the function, for every possible pivot selection.

	Example 1:

	             sequence has only one element, 7 will be chosen as the pivot.

	             true.
	
	Example 2:
	Input: nums = [-1,5,2]
	Output: 1
	Explanation: Searching for value -1 is guaranteed to be found. If -1 was 
	             chosen as the pivot, the function would return true. If 5 was 
	             chosen as the pivot, 5 and 2 would be removed. In the next 
	             loop, the sequence would have only -1 and the function would 
	             return true. If 2 was chosen as the pivot, 2 would be removed. 
	             In the next loop, the sequence would have -1 and 5. No matter 
	             which number was chosen as the next pivot, the function would 
	             find -1 and return true. Searching for value 5 is NOT 
	             guaranteed to be found. If 2 was chosen as the pivot, -1, 5 
	             and 2 would be removed. The sequence would be empty and the 
	             function would return false. Searching for value 2 is NOT

	             A student might have used this incorrect order of operations:

	Example 3:
	Input: s = "6+0*1", answers = [12,9,6,4,8,6]
	Output: 10
	Explanation: The correct answer of the expression is 6. If a student had 
	             used some incorrect order of operations, the answer would also 
	             be 6. By the rules of grading, the students will still be

	Example 1:

	             The sum of the removed stones is 1 + 2 = 3 and is divisible by

	the color of the ith piece. Alice and Bob are playing a game where they 
	take alternating turns removing pieces from the line. In this game, Alice 
	moves first.
	* Alice is only allowed to remove a piece colored 'A' if both its neighbors 
	  are also colored 'A'. She is not allowed to remove pieces that are 
	  colored 'B'.
	* Bob is only allowed to remove a piece colored 'B' if both its neighbors 
	  are also colored 'B'. He is not allowed to remove pieces that are colored

	Explanation: Alice has her turn first. There are only two 'A's and both are

	There is a network of n servers, labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given a

	message channel between servers ui and vi, and they can pass any number of 
	messages to each other directly in one second. You are also given a 
	0-indexed integer array patience of length n. All servers are connected, 
	i.e., a message can be passed from one server to any other server(s) 
	directly or indirectly through the message channels. The server labeled 0 
	is the master server. The rest are data servers. Each data server needs to 
	send its message to the master server for processing and wait for a reply. 
	Messages move between servers optimally, so every message takes the least 
	amount of time to arrive at the master server. The master server will 
	process all newly arrived messages instantly and send a reply to the 
	originating server via the reversed path the message had gone through. At 
	the beginning of second 0, each data server sends its message to be 
	processed. Starting from second 1, at the beginning of every second, each 
	data server will check if it has received a reply to the message it sent 
	(including any newly arrived replies) from the master server:
	* If it has not, it will resend the message periodically. The data server 
	  i will resend the message every patience[i] second(s), i.e., the data 
	  server i will resend the message if patience[i] second(s) have elapsed 
	  since the last time the message was sent from this server.
	* Otherwise, no more resending will occur from this server.

	or arriving at servers. Return the earliest second starting from which the 
	network becomes idle.

    """2045. Second Minimum Time to Reach Destination (Hard)
	A city is represented as a bi-directional connected graph with n vertices 
	where each vertex is labeled from 1 to n (inclusive). The edges in the 
	graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each 
	edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and 
	vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no 
	vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is time 
	minutes. Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from 
	green to red and vice versa every change minutes. All signals change at the 
	same time. You can enter a vertex at any time, but can leave a vertex only 
	when the signal is green. You cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is 
	green. The second minimum value is defined as the smallest value strictly 
	larger than the minimum value. For example the second minimum value of 
	[2, 3, 4] is 3, and the second minimum value of [2, 2, 4] is 4. Given n, 
	edges, time, and change, return the second minimum time it will take to go 
	from vertex 1 to vertex n.

	Notes:
	* You can go through any vertex any number of times, including 1 and n.
	* You can assume that when the journey starts, all signals have just turned 
	  green.

	Example 1:
	Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[3,4],[4,5]], time = 3, change = 5
	Output: 13
	Explanation: The figure on the left shows the given graph. The blue path in 
	             the figure on the right is the minimum time path. The time 
	             taken is:

	             - 1 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
	             - 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6
	             Hence the minimum time needed is 6 minutes. The red path shows 
	             the path to get the second minimum time.
	             - Start at 1, time elapsed=0
	             - 1 -> 3: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
	             - 3 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6

	             - 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=13
	             Hence the second minimum time is 13 minutes.      
	
	Example 2:

    """2056. Number of Valid Move Combinations On Chessboard (Hard)
	There is an 8 x 8 chessboard containing n pieces (rooks, queens, or 
	bishops). You are given a string array pieces of length n, where pieces[i] 
	describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the ith piece. In addition, 
	you are given a 2D integer array positions also of length n, where 
	positions[i] = [ri, ci] indicates that the ith piece is currently at the 
	1-based coordinate (ri, ci) on the chessboard. When making a move for a 
	piece, you choose a destination square that the piece will travel toward 
	and stop on.
	* A rook can only travel horizontally or vertically from (r, c) to the 
	  direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), or (r, c-1).
	* A queen can only travel horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from 
	  (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), (r, c-1), 
	  (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).
	* A bishop can only travel diagonally from (r, c) to the direction of 
	  (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).
	You must make a move for every piece on the board simultaneously. A move 
	combination consists of all the moves performed on all the given pieces. 
	Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel one square towards 
	their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start 
	traveling at the 0th second. A move combination is invalid if, at a given 
	time, two or more pieces occupy the same square. Return the number of valid 
	move combinations.

	Notes:
	* No two pieces will start in the same square.
	* You may choose the square a piece is already on as its destination.
	* If two pieces are directly adjacent to each other, it is valid for them 
	  to move past each other and swap positions in one second.

	Example 1:
	Input: pieces = ["rook"], positions = [[1,1]]
	Output: 15
	Explanation: The image above shows the possible squares the piece can move to.

	Example 2:
	Input: pieces = ["queen"], positions = [[1,1]]

	Explanation: The image above shows the possible squares the piece can move to.

	Example 3:
	Input: pieces = ["bishop"], positions = [[4,3]]
	Output: 12
	Explanation: The image above shows the possible squares the piece can move to.

	Example 4:
	Input: pieces = ["rook","rook"], positions = [[1,1],[8,8]]
	Output: 223
	Explanation: There are 15 moves for each rook which results in 15 * 15 = 225 
	             move combinations. However, there are two invalid move 
	             combinations:
	             - Move both rooks to (8, 1), where they collide.
	             - Move both rooks to (1, 8), where they collide.
	             Thus there are 225 - 2 = 223 valid move combinations. Note that 
	             there are two valid move combinations that would result in one 
	             rook at (1, 8) and the other at (8, 1). Even though the board 
	             state is the same, these two move combinations are considered 
	             different since the moves themselves are different.
	
	Example 5:
	Input: pieces = ["queen","bishop"], positions = [[5,7],[3,4]]
	Output: 281
	Explanation: There are 12 * 24 = 288 move combinations. However, there are 
	             several invalid move combinations:
	             - If the queen stops at (6, 7), it blocks the bishop from 
	               moving to (6, 7) or (7, 8).
	             - If the queen stops at (5, 6), it blocks the bishop from 
	               moving to (5, 6), (6, 7), or (7, 8).
	             - If the bishop stops at (5, 2), it blocks the queen from 
	               moving to (5, 2) or (5, 1).
	             Of the 288 move combinations, 281 are valid.

	local minima if the current node has a value strictly smaller than the

	* Arbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and 
	  replace each with its length (as a numeric string).
	* Concatenate the sequence as the encoded string.
	For example, one way to encode an original string "abcdefghijklmnop" might 
	be:
	* Split it as a sequence: ["ab", "cdefghijklmn", "o", "p"].
	* Choose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, 
	  respectively. The sequence becomes ["ab", "12", "1", "p"].
	* Concatenate the elements of the sequence to get the encoded string:

	You are given the head of a linked list. The nodes in the linked list are

	A string originalText is encoded using a slanted transposition cipher to a

	The blue cells are filled first, followed by the red cells, then the yellow 
	cells, and so on, until we reach the end of originalText. The arrow 
	indicates the order in which the cells are filled. All empty cells are 
	filled with ' '. The number of columns is chosen such that the rightmost 
	column will not be empty after filling in originalText. encodedText is then 
	formed by appending all characters of the matrix in a row-wise fashion. The 
	characters in the blue cells are appended first to encodedText, then the

	Output: -1
	Explanation: There is no empty space to place a bucket to collect the

	* The number of cells in the set has to be greater than 1 and all cells 
	  must be fertile.
	* The apex of a pyramid is the topmost cell of the pyramid. The height of a 
	  pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let (r, c) be the apex of the

	You are given a 0-indexed array nums of n integers, and an integer k. The

	the index i, then the k-radius average is -1. Build and return an array 
	avgs of length n where avgs[i] is the k-radius average for the subarray 
	centered at index i. The average of x elements is the sum of the x elements 
	divided by x, using integer division. The integer division truncates toward 
	zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, the average of 
	four elements 2, 3, 1, and 5 is (2 + 3 + 1 + 5) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75, which 
	truncates to 2.

	Example 1:
	Input: nums = [7,4,3,9,1,8,5,2,6], k = 3
	Output: [-1,-1,-1,5,4,4,-1,-1,-1]

    """2092. Find All People With Secret (Hard)
	You are given an integer n indicating there are n people numbered from 0 to

	meetings[i] = [xi, yi, timei] indicates that person xi and person yi have a 
	meeting at timei. A person may attend multiple meetings at the same time. 
	Finally, you are given an integer firstPerson. Person 0 has a secret and 
	initially shares the secret with a person firstPerson at time 0. This 
	secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a person that 
	has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person xi has the 
	secret at timei, then they will share the secret with person yi, and vice 
	versa. The secrets are shared instantaneously. That is, a person may 
	receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the 
	same time frame. Return a list of all the people that have the secret after 
	all the meetings have taken place. You may return the answer in any order.

	             At time 3, person 3 shares the secret with person 0 and person 1.

    """2094. Finding 3-Digit Even Numbers (Easy)
	You are given an integer array digits, where each element is a digit. The 
	array may contain duplicates. You need to find all the unique integers that 
	follow the given requirements:
	* The integer consists of the concatenation of three elements from digits

	* The integer does not have leading zeros.
	* The integer is even.
	For example, if the given digits were [1, 2, 3], integers 132 and 312 
	follow the requirements. Return a sorted array of the unique integers.

	Example 1:
	Input: digits = [2,1,3,0]

	* The number of guards at the bank for the time days before i are non-

	* The first character of the ith pair denotes the ith ring's color 
	  ('R', 'G', 'B').
	* The second character of the ith pair denotes the rod that the ith ring is 
	  placed on ('0' to '9').
	For example, "R3G2B1" describes n == 3 rings: a red ring placed onto the

    """2105. Watering Plants II (Medium)
	Alice and Bob want to water n plants in their garden. The plants are 
	arranged in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where 
	the ith plant is located at x = i. Each plant needs a specific amount of 
	water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, initially full. They water 
	the plants in the following way:
	* Alice waters the plants in order from left to right, starting from the 
	  0th plant. Bob waters the plants in order from right to left, starting 
	  from the (n - 1)th plant. They begin watering the plants simultaneously.
	* If one does not have enough water to completely water the current plant, 
	  he/she refills the watering can instantaneously.
	* It takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how 
	  much water it needs.
	* One cannot refill the watering can early.
	* Each plant can be watered either by Alice or by Bob.
	* In case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water 
	  currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have 
	  the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.
	Given a 0-indexed integer array plants of n integers, where plants[i] is 
	the amount of water the ith plant needs, and two integers capacityA and 
	capacityB representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans 
	respectively, return the number of times they have to refill to water all 
	the plants.

	Example 1:
	Input: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacityA = 5, capacityB = 5
	Output: 1
	Explanation:
	- Initially, Alice and Bob have 5 units of water each in their watering 
	  cans.
	- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
	- Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively.
	- Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it. Bob does not have 
	  enough water for plant 2, so he refills his can then waters it.
	So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants 
	is 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.
	
	Example 2:
	Input: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacityA = 3, capacityB = 4
	Output: 2
	Explanation:
	- Initially, Alice and Bob have 3 units and 4 units of water in their 
	  watering cans respectively.
	- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
	- Alice and Bob now have 1 unit of water each, and need to water plants 1 
	  and 2 respectively.
	- Since neither of them have enough water for their current plants, they 
	  refill their cans and then water the plants.
	So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants 
	is 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.
	
	Example 3:
	Input: plants = [5], capacityA = 10, capacityB = 8
	Output: 0
	Explanation:
	- There is only one plant.
	- Alice's watering can has 10 units of water, whereas Bob's can has 8 units. 
	  Since Alice has more water in her can, she waters this plant.
	So, the total number of times they have to refill is 0.
	
	Example 4:
	Input: plants = [1,2,4,4,5], capacityA = 6, capacityB = 5
	Output: 2
	Explanation:
	- Initially, Alice and Bob have 6 units and 5 units of water in their 
	  watering cans respectively.
	- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 4.
	- Alice and Bob now have 5 units and 0 units of water respectively.
	- Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it. Bob does not have 
	  enough water for plant 3, so he refills his can then waters it.
	- Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 1 unit of water respectively.
	- Since Alice has more water, she waters plant 2. However, she does not 
	  have enough water to completely water this plant. Hence she refills her 
	  can then waters it.
	So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants 
	is 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.
	
	Example 5:
	Input: plants = [2,2,5,2,2], capacityA = 5, capacityB = 5
	Output: 1
	Explanation: Both Alice and Bob will reach the middle plant with the same 
	             amount of water, so Alice will water it. She will have 1 unit 
	             of water when she reaches it, so she will refill her can. This 
	             is the only refill needed.

	arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i, where k <= i <= n-1. 
	* For example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is K-increasing for k = 2 because:
	  o arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)
	  o arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)
	  o arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)

	             is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10]

	Example 2:
	Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2
	Output: 0
	Explanation: This is the same example as the one in the problem description. 
	             Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i].
	             Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need

    """2117. Abbreviating the Product of a Range (Hard)
	You are given two positive integers left and right with left <= right. 
	Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].
	Since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these 
	steps:
	* Count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote 
	  this count as C.
	  For example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing 
	  zeros in 546.
	* Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, 
	  then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 
	  digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product 
	  after removing all trailing zeros. If d <= 10, we keep it unchanged.
	  For example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321, but 1234567 is 
	  represented as 1234567.
	* Finally, represent the product as a string "<pre>...<suf>eC".
	  For example, 12345678987600000 will be represented as "12345...89876e5".
	Return a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the 
	inclusive range [left, right].

	Example 1:
	Input: left = 1, right = 4
	Output: "24e0"
	Explanation: The product is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24. There are no trailing zeros, 
	             so 24 remains the same. The abbreviation will end with "e0". 
	             Since the number of digits is 2, which is less than 10, we do 
	             not have to abbreviate it further. Thus, the final 
	             representation is "24e0". 
	
	Example 2:
	Input: left = 2, right = 11
	Output: "399168e2"
	Explanation: The product is 39916800. There are 2 trailing zeros, which we 
	             remove to get 399168. The abbreviation will end with "e2". The 
	             number of digits after removing the trailing zeros is 6, so we 
	             do not abbreviate it further. Hence, the abbreviated product 
	             is "399168e2".  
	
	Example 3:

	Each employee has a favorite person and they will attend the meeting only 
	if they can sit next to their favorite person at the table. The favorite 
	person of an employee is not themself. Given a 0-indexed integer array

    """2138. Divide a String Into Groups of Size k (Easy)
	A string s can be partitioned into groups of size k using the following 
	procedure:
	* The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the 
	  second group consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. 
	  Each character can be a part of exactly one group.
	* For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a 
	  character fill is used to complete the group.
	Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character 
	from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in 
	order, the resultant string should be s. Given the string s, the size of 
	each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting the 
	composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above 
	procedure.

	Example 1:
	Input: s = "abcdefghi", k = 3, fill = "x"
	Output: ["abc","def","ghi"]
	Explanation: The first 3 characters "abc" form the first group. The next 3 
	             characters "def" form the second group. The last 3 characters 
	             "ghi" form the third group. Since all groups can be completely 
	             filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use 
	             fill. Thus, the groups formed are "abc", "def", and "ghi".
	
	Example 2:
	Input: s = "abcdefghij", k = 3, fill = "x"
	Output: ["abc","def","ghi","jxx"]
	Explanation: Similar to the previous example, we are forming the first 
	             three groups "abc", "def", and "ghi". For the last group, we 
	             can only use the character 'j' from the string. To complete 
	             this group, we add 'x' twice. Thus, the 4 groups formed are 
	             "abc", "def", "ghi", and "jxx".

"""146. LRU Cache (Medium)
Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It 
should support the following operations: get and put. 
get(key)        - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key 
                  exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. 

When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently 
used item before inserting a new item. The cache is initialized with a positive 
capacity.

Follow up: Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?

Example:
LRUCache cache = new LRUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );

cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1

Example:
Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: [1,2,3].
Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.
Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after 
that still return 2. 
You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. 
Calling hasNext() after that should return false.

"""288. Unique Word Abbreviation (Medium)
The abbreviation of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, the number 
of characters between the first and last letter, and its last letter. If a word 
has only two characters, then it is an abbreviation of itself.

For example:
* dog --> d1g because there is one letter between the first letter 'd' and the 
  last letter 'g'.
* internationalization --> i18n because there are 18 letters between the first 
  letter 'i' and the last letter 'n'.
* it --> it because any word with only two characters is an abbreviation of 
  itself.

Implement the ValidWordAbbr class:
* ValidWordAbbr(String[] dictionary) Initializes the object with a dictionary 
  of words.

  conditions are met (otherwise returns false):
  + There is no word in dictionary whose abbreviation is equal to word's 
    abbreviation.
  + For any word in dictionary whose abbreviation is equal to word's 
    abbreviation, that word and word are the same.

"""295. Find Median from Data Stream (Hard)
Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list

"""359. Logger Rate Limiter (Easy)
Design a logger system that receives a stream of messages along with their 
timestamps. Each unique message should only be printed at most every 10 seconds 
(i.e. a message printed at timestamp t will prevent other identical messages 
from being printed until timestamp t + 10). All messages will come in 
chronological order. Several messages may arrive at the same timestamp.

Implement the Logger class:
* Logger() Initializes the logger object.
* bool shouldPrintMessage(int timestamp, string message) Returns true if the message should be printed in the given timestamp, otherwise returns false.

Example 1:
Input: ["Logger", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage", "shouldPrintMessage"]
       [[], [1, "foo"], [2, "bar"], [3, "foo"], [8, "bar"], [10, "foo"], [11, "foo"]]
Output: [null, true, true, false, false, false, true]
Explanation:
Logger logger = new Logger();
logger.shouldPrintMessage(1, "foo");  // return true, next allowed timestamp for "foo" is 1 + 10 = 11
logger.shouldPrintMessage(2, "bar");  // return true, next allowed timestamp for "bar" is 2 + 10 = 12
logger.shouldPrintMessage(3, "foo");  // 3 < 11, return false
logger.shouldPrintMessage(8, "bar");  // 8 < 12, return false
logger.shouldPrintMessage(10, "foo"); // 10 < 11, return false
logger.shouldPrintMessage(11, "foo"); // 11 >= 11, return true, next allowed timestamp for "foo" is
                                      // 11 + 10 = 21
 
Constraints:
* 0 <= timestamp <= 10^9
* Every timestamp will be passed in non-decreasing order (chronological order).
* 1 <= message.length <= 30
* At most 10^4 calls will be made to shouldPrintMessage."""

at the same time.

"""604. Design Compressed String Iterator (Easy)
Design and implement a data structure for a compressed string iterator. The 
given compressed string will be in the form of each letter followed by a 
positive integer representing the number of this letter existing in the original 
uncompressed string.

Implement the StringIterator class:
* next() Returns the next character if the original string still has uncompressed characters, otherwise returns a white space.
* hasNext() Returns true if there is any letter needs to be uncompressed in the original string, otherwise returns false.

Example 1:
Input: ["StringIterator", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext"]
       [["L1e2t1C1o1d1e1"], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]

"""635. Design Log Storage System (Medium)
You are given several logs, where each log contains a unique ID and timestamp. 
Timestamp is a string that has the following format: 
Year:Month:Day:Hour:Minute:Second, for example, 2017:01:01:23:59:59. All 
domains are zero-padded decimal numbers. Implement the LogSystem class:
* LogSystem() Initializes the LogSystem object.
* void put(int id, string timestamp) Stores the given log (id, timestamp) in 
  your storage system.
* int[] retrieve(string start, string end, string granularity) Returns the IDs 
  of the logs whose timestamps are within the range from start to end inclusive. 
  start and end all have the same format as timestamp, and granularity means 
  how precise the range should be (i.e. to the exact Day, Minute, etc.). For 
  example, start = "2017:01:01:23:59:59", end = "2017:01:02:23:59:59", and 
  granularity = "Day" means that we need to find the logs within the inclusive

"""706. Design HashMap (Easy)
Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries. To be 
specific, your design should include these functions:
* put(key, value) : Insert a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the value 
  already exists in the HashMap, update the value.
* get(key): Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if 
  this map contains no mapping for the key.
* remove(key) : Remove the mapping for the value key if this map contains the 
  mapping for the key.

Example:
MyHashMap hashMap = new MyHashMap();
hashMap.put(1, 1);          
hashMap.put(2, 2);         
hashMap.get(1);            // returns 1

"""729. My Calendar I (Medium)
Implement a MyCalendar class to store your events. A new event can be added if 
adding the event will not cause a double booking. Your class will have the 
method, book(int start, int end). Formally, this represents a booking on the 
half open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that 
start <= x < end. A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty 
intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to both events.) For each 
call to the method MyCalendar.book, return true if the event can be added to 
the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return 
false and do not add the event to the calendar. Your class will be called like 
this: MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar(); MyCalendar.book(start, end)

Example 1:
MyCalendar();
MyCalendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(15, 25); // returns false
MyCalendar.book(20, 30); // returns true
Explanation: 
The first event can be booked. The second can't because time 15 is already 
booked by another event. The third event can be booked, as the first event 
takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.

Note:
* The number of calls to MyCalendar.book per test case will be at most 1000.
* In calls to MyCalendar.book(start, end), start and end are integers in the

"""900. RLE Iterator (Medium)
We can use run-length encoding (i.e., RLE) to encode a sequence of integers. 
In a run-length encoded array of even length encoding (0-indexed), for all even 
i, encoding[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value 
encoding[i + 1] is repeated in the sequence. 

For example, the sequence arr = [8,8,8,5,5] can be encoded to be 
encoding = [3,8,2,5]. encoding = [3,8,0,9,2,5] and encoding = [2,8,1,8,2,5] are 
also valid RLE of arr. Given a run-length encoded array, design an iterator that 
iterates through it. Implement the RLEIterator class:
* RLEIterator(int[] encoded) Initializes the object with the encoded array 
  encoded.
* int next(int n) Exhausts the next n elements and returns the last element 
  exhausted in this way. If there is no element left to exhaust, return -1 
  instead.

Example 1:
Input: ["RLEIterator", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
       [[[3, 8, 0, 9, 2, 5]], [2], [1], [1], [2]]
Output: [null, 8, 8, 5, -1]
Explanation:

rLEIterator.next(2); // exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8. The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].
rLEIterator.next(1); // exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8. The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].
rLEIterator.next(1); // exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5. The remaining sequence is now [5].
rLEIterator.next(2); // exhausts 2 terms, returning -1. This is because the first term exhausted was 5,
but the second term did not exist. Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.

Constraints:
* 2 <= encoding.length <= 1000

Votes cast at time t will count towards our query.  In the case of a tie, the 
most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.

"""1117. Building H2O (Medium)
There are two kinds of threads, oxygen and hydrogen. Your goal is to group 
these threads to form water molecules. There is a barrier where each thread 
has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen 
threads will be given releaseHydrogen and releaseOxygen methods respectively, 
which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the 
barrier in groups of three, and they must be able to immediately bond with 
each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads 
from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.

In other words:
* If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are 
  present, it has to wait for two hydrogen threads.
* If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are 
  present, it has to wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.
We don’t have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; that is, the 
threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. 
The key is just that threads pass the barrier in complete sets; thus, if we 
examine the sequence of threads that bond and divide them into groups of three, 
each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads. Write 
synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these 
constraints.

"""1206. Design Skiplist (Hard)
Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries. A Skiplist is a data 
structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with 
treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code 
length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists are 
just simple linked lists. For example: we have a Skiplist containing 
[30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. You can see there are 
many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help 
of the top layers, add , erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be 
proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and 
space complexity is O(n). To be specific, your design should include these 
functions:
* bool search(int target) : Return whether the target exists in the Skiplist or 
  not.
* void add(int num): Insert a value into the SkipList. 
* bool erase(int num): Remove a value in the Skiplist. If num does not exist in 
  the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exists multiple num 
  values, removing any one of them is fine.
See more about Skiplist : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list. Note that 
duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

Example:
Skiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();
skiplist.add(1);
skiplist.add(2);
skiplist.add(3);
skiplist.search(0);   // return false.
skiplist.add(4);
skiplist.search(1);   // return true.
skiplist.erase(0);    // return false, 0 is not in skiplist.
skiplist.erase(1);    // return true.
skiplist.search(1);   // return false, 1 has already been erased.

Constraints:
* 0 <= num, target <= 20000
* At most 50000 calls will be made to search, add, and erase."""

"""1226. The Dining Philosophers (Medium)
Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks 
are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers. Each philosopher must 
alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when 
they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one 
philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used 
by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they 
need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A 
philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they 
become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks. Eating is 
not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite 
supply and an infinite demand are assumed. Design a discipline of behaviour (a 
concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can 
forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no 
philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think. The problem 
statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org. 

The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement 
the function void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, 
putLeftFork, putRightFork) where:
* philosopher is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.
* pickLeftFork and pickRightFork are functions you can call to pick the 
  corresponding forks of that philosopher.
* eat is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked 
  both forks.
* putLeftFork and putRightFork are functions you can call to put down the 
  corresponding forks of that philosopher.
* The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to 
  eat (the function is not being called with their number).
Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one 
object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for 
the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: [[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[0,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[0,2,1],[4,2,2],[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2],[1,2,1],[1,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2]]
Explanation: n is the number of times each philosopher will call the function. 
             The output array describes the calls you made to the functions 
             controlling the forks and the eat function, its format is:
             output[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)
             - a is the id of a philosopher.
             - b specifies the fork: {1 : left, 2 : right}.

"""1500. Design a File Sharing System (Medium)
We will use a file-sharing system to share a very large file which consists of 
m small chunks with IDs from 1 to m. When users join the system, the system 
should assign a unique ID to them. The unique ID should be used once for each 
user, but when a user leaves the system, the ID can be reused again. Users can 
request a certain chunk of the file, the system should return a list of IDs of 
all the users who own this chunk. If the user receives a non-empty list of IDs, 
they receive the requested chunk successfully.

Implement the FileSharing class:
* FileSharing(int m) Initializes the object with a file of m chunks.
* int join(int[] ownedChunks): A new user joined the system owning some chunks 
  of the file, the system should assign an id to the user which is the smallest 
  positive integer not taken by any other user. Return the assigned id.
* void leave(int userID): The user with userID will leave the system, you 
  cannot take file chunks from them anymore.
* int[] request(int userID, int chunkID): The user userID requested the file 
  chunk with chunkID. Return a list of the IDs of all users that own this chunk 
  sorted in ascending order.

Example:
Input: ["FileSharing","join","join","join","request","request","leave","request","leave","join"]
       [[4],[[1,2]],[[2,3]],[[4]],[1,3],[2,2],[1],[2,1],[2],[[]]]

fileSharing.join([4]);       // A user who has chunk [4] joined the system, assign id = 3 to them and return 3.
fileSharing.request(1, 3);   // The user with id = 1 requested the third file chunk, as only the user with id = 2 has the file, return [2] . Notice that user 1 now has chunks [1,2,3].
fileSharing.request(2, 2);   // The user with id = 2 requested the second file chunk, users with ids [1,2] have this chunk, thus we return [1,2].
fileSharing.leave(1);        // The user with id = 1 left the system, all the file chunks with them are no longer available for other users.
fileSharing.request(2, 1);   // The user with id = 2 requested the first file chunk, no one in the system has this chunk, we return empty list [].
fileSharing.leave(2);        // The user with id = 2 left the system.
fileSharing.join([]);        // A user who doesn't have any chunks joined the system, assign id = 1 to them and return 1. Notice that ids 1 and 2 are free and we can reuse them.

Constraints:
* 1 <= m <= 10^5
* 0 <= ownedChunks.length <= min(100, m)
* 1 <= ownedChunks[i] <= m
* Values of ownedChunks are unique.
* 1 <= chunkID <= m
* userID is guaranteed to be a user in the system if you assign the IDs 
  correctly.
* At most 10^4 calls will be made to join, leave and request.
* Each call to leave will have a matching call for join.

Follow-up:
* What happens if the system identifies the user by their IP address instead of 
  their unique ID and users disconnect and connect from the system with the 
  same IP?
* If the users in the system join and leave the system frequently without 
  requesting any chunks, will your solution still be efficient?
* If all users join the system one time, request all files, and then leave, 
  will your solution still be efficient?
* If the system will be used to share n files where the ith file consists of 
  m[i], what are the changes you have to make?"""

"""1586. Binary Search Tree Iterator II (Medium)
Implement the BSTIterator class that represents an iterator over the in-order 
traversal of a binary search tree (BST):
* BSTIterator(TreeNode root) Initializes an object of the BSTIterator class. 
  The root of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should 
  be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
* boolean hasNext() Returns true if there exists a number in the traversal to 
  the right of the pointer, otherwise returns false.
* int next() Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the 
  pointer.
* boolean hasPrev() Returns true if there exists a number in the traversal to 
  the left of the pointer, otherwise returns false.
* int prev() Moves the pointer to the left, then returns the number at the 
  pointer.
Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the 
first call to next() will return the smallest element in the BST. You may 
assume that next() and prev() calls will always be valid. That is, there will 
be at least a next/previous number in the in-order traversal when next()/prev()

Note that if a token expires at time t, and another action happens on time t 
(renew or countUnexpiredTokens), the expiration takes place before the other 
actions.

Example 1:

Explanation: 
AuthenticationManager authenticationManager = new AuthenticationManager(5); // Constructs the AuthenticationManager with timeToLive = 5 seconds.
authenticationManager.renew("aaa", 1); // No token exists with tokenId "aaa" at time 1, so nothing happens.
authenticationManager.generate("aaa", 2); // Generates a new token with tokenId "aaa" at time 2.
authenticationManager.countUnexpiredTokens(6); // The token with tokenId "aaa" is the only unexpired one at time 6, so return 1.
authenticationManager.generate("bbb", 7); // Generates a new token with tokenId "bbb" at time 7.
authenticationManager.renew("aaa", 8); // The token with tokenId "aaa" expired at time 7, and 8 >= 7, so at time 8 the renew request is ignored, and nothing happens.
authenticationManager.renew("bbb", 10); // The token with tokenId "bbb" is unexpired at time 10, so the renew request is fulfilled and now the token will expire at time 15.
authenticationManager.countUnexpiredTokens(15); // The token with tokenId "bbb" expires at time 15, and the token with tokenId "aaa" expired at time 7, so currently no token is unexpired, so return 0.

"""1825. Finding MK Average (Hard)
You are given two integers, m and k, and a stream of integers. You are tasked 
to implement a data structure that calculates the MKAverage for the stream.
The MKAverage can be calculated using these steps:
* If the number of the elements in the stream is less than m you should 
  consider the MKAverage to be -1. Otherwise, copy the last m elements of the 
  stream to a separate container.
* Remove the smallest k elements and the largest k elements from the container.
* Calculate the average value for the rest of the elements rounded down to the 
  nearest integer.

Implement the MKAverage class:
* MKAverage(int m, int k) Initializes the MKAverage object with an empty stream 
  and the two integers m and k.
* void addElement(int num) Inserts a new element num into the stream.
* int calculateMKAverage() Calculates and returns the MKAverage for the current 
  stream rounded down to the nearest integer.

You have a movie renting company consisting of n shops. You want to implement a

Each movie is given as a 2D integer array entries where 
entries[i] = [shopi, moviei, pricei] indicates that there is a copy of movie 
moviei at shop shopi with a rental price of pricei. Each shop carries at most 
one copy of a movie moviei. The system should support the following functions:
* Search: Finds the cheapest 5 shops that have an unrented copy of a given movie. 
  The shops should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, 
  the one with the smaller shopi should appear first. If there are less than 5 
  matching shops, then all of them should be returned. If no shop has an 
  unrented copy, then an empty list should be returned.
* Rent: Rents an unrented copy of a given movie from a given shop.
* Drop: Drops off a previously rented copy of a given movie at a given shop.
* Report: Returns the cheapest 5 rented movies (possibly of the same movie ID) 
  as a 2D list res where res[j] = [shopj, moviej] describes that the jth 
  cheapest rented movie moviej was rented from the shop shopj. The movies in 
  res should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the 
  one with the smaller shopj should appear first, and if there is still tie,

"""2034. Stock Price Fluctuation (Medium)
You are given a stream of records about a particular stock. Each record 
contains a timestamp and the corresponding price of the stock at that timestamp.
Unfortunately due to the volatile nature of the stock market, the records do 
not come in order. Even worse, some records may be incorrect. Another record 
with the same timestamp may appear later in the stream correcting the price of 
the previous wrong record. Design an algorithm that:
* Updates the price of the stock at a particular timestamp, correcting the 
  price from any previous records at the timestamp.
* Finds the latest price of the stock based on the current records. The latest 
  price is the price at the latest timestamp recorded.
* Finds the maximum price the stock has been based on the current records.
* Finds the minimum price the stock has been based on the current records.

Implement the StockPrice class:
* StockPrice() Initializes the object with no price records.
* void update(int timestamp, int price) Updates the price of the stock at the 
  given timestamp.
* int current() Returns the latest price of the stock.
* int maximum() Returns the maximum price of the stock.
* int minimum() Returns the minimum price of the stock.

stockPrice.update(2, 5);  // Timestamps are [1,2] with corresponding prices [10,5].
stockPrice.current();     // return 5, the latest timestamp is 2 with the price being 5.
stockPrice.maximum();     // return 10, the maximum price is 10 at timestamp 1.
stockPrice.update(1, 3);  // The previous timestamp 1 had the wrong price, so it is updated to 3.
                          // Timestamps are [1,2] with corresponding prices [3,5].

You have been tasked with writing a program for a popular bank that will 
automate all its incoming transactions (transfer, deposit, and withdraw). The 
bank has n accounts numbered from 1 to n. The initial balance of each account 
is stored in a 0-indexed integer array balance, with the (i + 1)th account 
having an initial balance of balance[i]. Execute all the valid transactions. A

"""2069. Walking Robot Simulation II (Medium)
A width x height grid is on an XY-plane with the bottom-left cell at (0, 0) and 
the top-right cell at (width - 1, height - 1). The grid is aligned with the 
four cardinal directions ("North", "East", "South", and "West"). A robot is 
initially at cell (0, 0) facing direction "East". The robot can be instructed 
to move for a specific number of steps. For each step, it does the following.

Attempts to move forward one cell in the direction it is facing.
* If the cell the robot is moving to is out of bounds, the robot instead turns 
  90 degrees counterclockwise and retries the step.
* After the robot finishes moving the number of steps required, it stops and 
  awaits the next instruction.

Implement the Robot class:
* Robot(int width, int height) Initializes the width x height grid with the 
  robot at (0, 0) facing "East".
* void move(int num) Instructs the robot to move forward num steps.
* int[] getPos() Returns the current cell the robot is at, as an array of

"""2102. Sequentially Ordinal Rank Tracker (Hard)
A scenic location is represented by its name and attractiveness score, where 
name is a unique string among all locations and score is an integer. Locations 
can be ranked from the best to the worst. The higher the score, the better the 
location. If the scores of two locations are equal, then the location with the 
lexicographically smaller name is better. You are building a system that tracks 
the ranking of locations with the system initially starting with no locations. 
It supports:
* Adding scenic locations, one at a time.
* Querying the ith best location of all locations already added, where i is the 
  number of times the system has been queried (including the current query).
For example, when the system is queried for the 4th time, it returns the 4th 
best location of all locations already added. Note that the test data are 
generated so that at any time, the number of queries does not exceed the number 
of locations added to the system. Implement the SORTracker class:
* SORTracker() Initializes the tracker system.
* void add(string name, int score) Adds a scenic location with name and score 
  to the system.
* string get() Queries and returns the ith best location, where i is the number 
  of times this method has been invoked (including this invocation).
