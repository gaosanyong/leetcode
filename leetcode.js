/*2648. Generate Fibonacci Sequence (Easy)
Write a generator function that returns a generator object which yields the 
fibonacci sequence. The fibonacci sequence is defined by the relation 
Xn = Xn-1 + Xn-2. The first few numbers of the series are 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

Example 1:
Input: callCount = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,3]
Explanation: const gen = fibGenerator();
             gen.next().value; // 0
             gen.next().value; // 1
             gen.next().value; // 1
             gen.next().value; // 2
             gen.next().value; // 3

Example 2:
Input: callCount = 0
Output: []
Explanation: gen.next() is never called so nothing is outputted

Constraints: 0 <= callCount <= 50*/

var fibGenerator = function*() {
    let f0 = 0, f1 = 1;
    while (true) {
        yield f0;
        [f0, f1] = [f1, f0+f1];
    }
};
