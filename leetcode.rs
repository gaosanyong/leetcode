/*1. Two Sum (Easy)
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two
numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would
have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can
return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:
* 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
* -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
* -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
* Only one valid answer exists.

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time
           complexity?*/

impl Solution {
    pub fn two_sum(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> Vec<i32> {
        let mut seen = std::collections::HashMap::new();
        for (i, &x) in nums.iter().enumerate() {
            let diff = target - x;
            if seen.contains_key(&diff) {
                let &j = seen.get(&diff).unwrap();
                return vec![j, i as i32];
            }
            seen.insert(x, i as i32);
        }
        panic!();
    }
}


/*9. Palindrome Number (Easy)
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes
             121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Constraints: -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1*/

impl Solution {
    pub fn is_palindrome(x: i32) -> bool {
        let s = x.to_string();
        return s == s.chars().rev().collect::<String>();
    }
}


/*13. Roman to Integer (Easy)
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and
M.
    Symbol       Value
    I             1
    V             5
    X             10
    L             50
    C             100
    D             500
    M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together.
12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII,
which is XX + V + II. Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest
from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the
number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it
making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as
IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
* I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
* X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
* C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Example 1:
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

Example 3:
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 15
* s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
* It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].*/

impl Solution {
    pub fn roman_to_int(s: String) -> i32 {
        let map = std::collections::HashMap::from([
            ('I', 1),
            ('V', 5),
            ('X', 10),
            ('L', 50),
            ('C', 100),
            ('D', 500),
            ('M', 1000)
        ]);
        let mut ans = 0;
        let chars: Vec<char> = s.chars().collect();
        for (i, ch) in chars.iter().enumerate() {
            let val = map.get(&ch).unwrap();
            if (i+1 < s.len() && val < map.get(&chars[i+1]).unwrap()) {
                ans -= val;
            } else {
                ans += val;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}


/*14. Longest Common Prefix (Easy)
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of
strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

Constraints:
* 1 <= strs.length <= 200
* 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
* strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.*/

impl Solution {
    pub fn longest_common_prefix(strs: Vec<String>) -> String {
        match strs.is_empty() {
            true => "".to_string(),
            _ => {
                strs.iter().skip(1).fold(strs[0].clone(), |acc, x| {
                     acc
                        .chars()
                        .zip(x.chars())
                        .take_while(|(x, y)| x == y)
                        .map(|(x, _)| x)
                        .collect()
                })
            }
        }
    }
}


/*20. Valid Parentheses (Easy)
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']',
determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
* Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
* Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
* Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example 1:
Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: s = "([])"
Output: true

Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
* s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.*/

impl Solution {
    pub fn is_valid(s: String) -> bool {
        let mut stack = Vec::new();
        for ch in s.chars() {
            match ch {
                '{' => stack.push('}'),
                '(' => stack.push(')'),
                '[' => stack.push(']'),
                _ => if Some(ch) != stack.pop() { return false },
            }
        }
        return stack.is_empty();
    }
}


/*26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (Easy)
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the
duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The
relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number
of unique elements in nums. Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be
k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
* Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the
  unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The
  remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
* Return k.

Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:
    int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
    int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

    int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

    assert k == expectedNums.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
    }
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of
             nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It does not matter what you leave
             beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of
             nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. It does not matter what
             you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
* -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
* nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.*/

impl Solution {
    pub fn remove_duplicates(nums: &mut Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        nums.dedup();
        nums.len() as i32
    }
}


/*27. Remove Element (Easy)
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in
nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number
of elements in nums which are not equal to val. Consider the number of elements
in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the
following things:
* Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the
  elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not
  important as well as the size of nums.
* Return k.

Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:
    int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
    int val = ...; // Value to remove
    int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                                // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

    int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

    assert k == expectedNums.length;
    sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
    for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
        assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
    }
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of
             nums being 2. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned
             k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of
             nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4. Note that the five elements can
             be returned in any order. It does not matter what you leave beyond
             the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Constraints:
* 0 <= nums.length <= 100
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 50
* 0 <= val <= 100*/

impl Solution {
    pub fn remove_element(nums: &mut Vec<i32>, val: i32) -> i32 {
        nums.retain(|&x| x != val);

/*28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String (Easy)
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence
of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6. The first occurrence is at index 0,
             so we return 0.

Example 2:
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

Constraints:
* 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4
* haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.*/

impl Solution {

/*35. Search Insert Position (Easy)
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index
if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were
inserted in order. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1

Example 3:

    }
}


/*58. Length of Last Word (Easy)
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last
word in the string. A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space
characters only.

Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Example 2:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Example 3:
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
* s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
* There will be at least one word in s.*/
