/*1. Two Sum (Easy)
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two
numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would
have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can
return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:
* 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
* -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
* -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
* Only one valid answer exists.

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time
           complexity?*/

impl Solution {
    pub fn two_sum(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> Vec<i32> {
        let mut seen = std::collections::HashMap::new();
        for (i, &x) in nums.iter().enumerate() {
            let diff = target - x;
            if seen.contains_key(&diff) {
                let &j = seen.get(&diff).unwrap();
                return vec![j, i as i32];
            }
            seen.insert(x, i as i32);
        }
        panic!();
    }
}


/*9. Palindrome Number (Easy)
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes
             121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Constraints: -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1*/

impl Solution {
    pub fn is_palindrome(x: i32) -> bool {
        let s = x.to_string();
        return s == s.chars().rev().collect::<String>();
    }
}


/*13. Roman to Integer (Easy)
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and
M.
    Symbol       Value
    I             1
    V             5
    X             10
    L             50
    C             100
    D             500
    M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together.
12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII,
which is XX + V + II. Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest
from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the
number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it
making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as
IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
* I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
* X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
* C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Example 1:
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

Example 3:
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 15
* s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
* It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].*/

impl Solution {
    pub fn roman_to_int(s: String) -> i32 {
        let map = std::collections::HashMap::from([
            ('I', 1),
            ('V', 5),
            ('X', 10),
            ('L', 50),
            ('C', 100),
            ('D', 500),
            ('M', 1000)
        ]);
        let mut ans = 0;
        let chars: Vec<char> = s.chars().collect();
        for (i, ch) in chars.iter().enumerate() {
            let val = map.get(&ch).unwrap();
            if (i+1 < s.len() && val < map.get(&chars[i+1]).unwrap()) {
                ans -= val;
            } else {
                ans += val;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}


/*14. Longest Common Prefix (Easy)
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of
strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

Constraints:
* 1 <= strs.length <= 200
* 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
* strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.*/

impl Solution {
    pub fn longest_common_prefix(strs: Vec<String>) -> String {
        match strs.is_empty() {
            true => "".to_string(),
            _ => {
                strs.iter().skip(1).fold(strs[0].clone(), |acc, x| {
                     acc
                        .chars()
                        .zip(x.chars())
                        .take_while(|(x, y)| x == y)
                        .map(|(x, _)| x)
                        .collect()
                })
            }
        }
    }
}


/*20. Valid Parentheses (Easy)
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']',
determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
* Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
* Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
* Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example 1:
Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: s = "([])"
Output: true

Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
* s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.*/

impl Solution {
    pub fn is_valid(s: String) -> bool {
        let mut stack = Vec::new();
        for ch in s.chars() {
            match ch {
                '{' => stack.push('}'),
                '(' => stack.push(')'),
                '[' => stack.push(']'),
                _ => if Some(ch) != stack.pop() { return false },
            }
        }
        return stack.is_empty();
    }
}
